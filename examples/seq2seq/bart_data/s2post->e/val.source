Only 730 were chosen. The scientists looked at the number of arrests by the teens in the study. One thing did not improve. The amount of crimes that were not violent did not go down for the teens with jobs.
The teens in the study also had an adult to help them out. The adult was a mentor. The Chicago program was called One Summer Plus. The teens in the program were paid $8.25 for every hour that they worked.
A new program in Chicago found jobs for some teenagers. Then a study showed that if teens have jobs, the number of violent crimes they do may go down. So they picked teenagers. Then they gave each one a job for eight weeks.
It also cost less money. Heller said it was too soon to know if the program was a good use of money. They will need to see if they find jobs and how long they work. Teens in the study held many different kinds of jobs.
She is mystery writer Agatha Christie. J.K. Rowling is the best-selling author of recent memory. Yet no woman has been chosen to be put on British money. "It's another instance of women's contributions being wiped out," Criado-Perez said.

In one stretch over 15 hours, the geese went up and down, over and over. But they only climbed about 1 mile over the mountains. The scientists wondered, why didn't the birds just fly in a straight line? The scientists realized that it was the best way to travel.
Scientists studied the birds, called bar-headed geese. They were on their way south for the winter. The scientists followed the birds across the world's tallest mountains. They found that the geese do not fly in a straight line.
In 2010, scientists took videos of a red fox. It was seen at Sonora Pass. It is north of Yosemite. The video showed the fox biting on a bag.
California protects 14 animals. The red fox is one of them. Scientists set up video cameras at Yosemite. The cameras took pictures of the fox in December and January.
There, experts will closely study the body parts to figure out who that person was. If they do find out, his family will be told. He is with the U.S. Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command. The command is in charge of finding missing and dead military members.
He is with the U.S. Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command. The command is in charge of finding missing and dead military members.

Businesses just can't find workers with the skills they need. The jobs go unfilled. Education and worker training are the problem. If nothing changes, it will get worse.
Things have been getting better over the past few weeks. Some of the biggest farms have given workers new toilets and beds. Now, things may improve even more. Last week, many of Mexico's largest farms said they would work together to improve working conditions.
Wal-Mart's approach has not worked well, however. One problem is that it is not always easy to get to the places where the workers live. Another problem is that farm owners are not always truthful. "You basically see what they choose to show you," said farming expert Devon Zagory.
"You basically see what they choose to show you," said farming expert Devon Zagory. He said the inspectors are asking the farm owners "where their worst secrets are." It is possible to find out how workers are being treated. Inspectors can make surprise visits.

"We can talk to each other and share our problems." Some are wondering why China's leaders made the law. Or, are they worried about how much money it costs to care for all the old people? Chen Honglin is a college teacher.
If an old person feels their children don't come home enough, they can take their grown child to court. Grandparents are important in China. When people grew old, their children let them move in. Their children and grandkids would take care of them until they died.
They asked for permission to come back into the U.S. There are about 11 million people living in the U.S. who were born elsewhere and came to the U.S. without permission. Lawmakers are trying to find a solution. While Congress works on the new laws, many immigrants have been sent away, or deported.

"It looks good on the outside, but all the pieces are ... [broken up] on the inside," Schmitt said. The study also shows that the shergottites weren't old rocks, Humayun said. "If they had found that it was 4 billion years old, I would eat my hat." The researchers plan to study other Martian meteorites.
Some carried signs with Trayvon Martin's picture. George Zimmerman was found not guilty in the shooting death of the Florida teenager. Emma Daniels is 70 years old. She wore a cap with buttons from the 1963 march.

It is called healthcare.gov. The problem is that it does not work. One way was to make a phone call to a call center. Operators there were should be able to help you sign up, he said.
Reports say the United States has spied on friendly countries. It gathered information about phone calls made by millions of Europeans. The White House said Monday that there needs to be new limits on how the U.S. gathers private information. A top senator also announced that spying on friendly nations would stop.
White House spokesman Jay Carney said something similar. Carney also said that technology is getting much better. That also means there needs to be more limits.
The new material contains elements called potassium, niobium, barium, and nickel. There are a lot of those elements around. Materials in older cells can be bad for the earth. There also are not much of those materials around.
So they have not been used to make solar panels. The Penn-Drexel team started with a material with polarity. Then the team added barium and nickel. Those elements let the material absorb energy from the right kind of light.
Those elements let the material absorb energy from the right kind of light. "The nickel is really doing the job," Anthony M. Rappe said. "The barium's kind of along for the ride." Making the material involved many steps.
There are not enough jobs for people in between. Fast-food workers are suffering for the same reasons that most workers are. The government wrote the rules of how companies can work. They wrote them in a way to help businesses make more money.
They have been making less and less money over the years. The government wrote the rules of how companies can work. But the rules do not pay attention to the workers. The very richest Americans are making much more money than they did 30 years ago.
They are making more money because the rules have changed. If pay had gone up since 1968 the way it did for many years before then, the lowest wage someone could take home would be $17 an hour today, not a measly $7.25. Some of the changes made it easier for companies to make their goods overseas. In some of these other countries, people will work for less money.
They can help stop climate change. Climate change is a shift in weather patterns. That leads to global warming. He says that climate change is "the No.

The U.S. has built new carriers that are an important step toward a better fleet. The first is the USS Gerald R. Ford. The Ford has important advances. They will allow it to be a powerful ship for a long time.
It also has a larger flight deck. And it has improved elevators to move missiles from below the deck to the surface. And fixing the new carriers is easier. That will make it cheaper to run the ships.
Aircraft carriers are giant ships that can hold many planes. They have a long deck that planes can use to take off and land. Over the past 10 years the U.S. has been fighting terrorists and rebels. That type of fighting doesn't need carriers.
Instead, the United States needs to make better use of its technology. New advances in technology could make carriers last longer. They're kind of like ray guns. Drones are planes that fly without pilots in them.
New advances in technology could make carriers last longer. New inventions can shoot energy or lasers, instead of missiles. Drones are planes that fly without pilots in them. They can be used on carriers now.
They are animals without a backbone. And they don't swim like fish. Now, scientists are trying to get them to fly. Not real jellyfish, but robots that move like them.
And jellyfish don't have bones. Their simple bodies look like an open umbrella or a bell. These hang down from their bell shape. They have a large mouth at the bottom of the bell.
It has four flapping wings that look like flower petals. The robot moves more like a moth than a jellyfish. They also squeeze water in and out of their bells to make them move. So far the robot jellyfish still has to be plugged in to work.

The area now attracts more than 300,000 visitors a year. Aside from the library, it has other attractions such as museums and theaters. He teaches architecture, the study of building design. Brown said a presidential library can attract people, but it will do better it if has other interesting things around it.
