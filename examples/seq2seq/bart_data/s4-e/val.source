The process is known as crossbreeding. It took Currie 12 years of growing peppers before he finally took the world record. He tested hundreds of combinations before he found one that was hot enough. A year ago, Guinness World Records officially called the Carolina Reaper the hottest pepper in the world.
Even after the jobs ended, the teenagers did fewer violent crimes. There were 1,634 teens who wanted to take part in the study. Only 730 were chosen. The scientists looked at the number of arrests by the teens in the study.
They also learned how to control their moods and act like adults. Some of these skills may have helped keep them out of serious trouble. The teens in the study also had an adult to help them out. The adult was a mentor.
Jobs might be one way to make the world a little bit safer. A new program in Chicago found jobs for some teenagers. Then a study showed that if teens have jobs, the number of violent crimes they do may go down.
They worked 25 hours each week. One Summer Plus lasted a shorter time than other job programs. It also cost less money. Heller said it was too soon to know if the program was a good use of money.

They climbed to get over a high peak and then sailed down when the ground dropped. They did extra work to keep flying over mountains, over and over again. In one stretch over 15 hours, the geese went up and down, over and over. But they only climbed about 1 mile over the mountains.
Some birds in Asia zoom up and down across some of the world's tallest mountains. Just like a roller coaster. Scientists studied the birds, called bar-headed geese. They were on their way south for the winter.
They burrow in soil and logs. Scientists do not know much about them. In 2010, scientists took videos of a red fox. It was seen at Sonora Pass.
A red fox was just seen in Yosemite National Park. It was the first time in almost 100 years. California protects 14 animals. The red fox is one of them.
They are also trying to find the bodies of the people who died. Whatever they find, like a skeleton, will be sent to a laboratory. There, experts will closely study the body parts to figure out who that person was. If they do find out, his family will be told.
If they do find out, his family will be told. The man in charge of the search for bodies is Gregory Berg. He is with the U.S. Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command. The command is in charge of finding missing and dead military members.
It did not mean they were for the attacks. Many people living outside Paris said they understood how they felt. "People were killed in the housing projects by police, and there was no minute of silence for them," said Aly Sacko. He is a Muslim.

The poisons get into fish. Then the sea lions eat the fish. There also may be too many sea lions and not enough food. California sea lions used to be hunted for their fur and a special kind of fat called blubber.
Jobs are out there. That's not the problem. Businesses just can't find workers with the skills they need. The jobs go unfilled.
Workers usually live on or near the farms. Their housing is provided by the farm owners. Things have been getting better over the past few weeks. Some of the biggest farms have given workers new toilets and beds.
Wal-Mart already has inspectors who visit farms. The inspectors give talks on how Wal-Mart wants farmworkers to be treated. Wal-Mart's approach has not worked well, however. One problem is that it is not always easy to get to the places where the workers live.
The farms are located all over Mexico. Another problem is that farm owners are not always truthful. "You basically see what they choose to show you," said farming expert Devon Zagory. He said the inspectors are asking the farm owners "where their worst secrets are."
They do not believe the bureau is doing this to help the horses. Horse supporters say that the agency is really helping ranchers. The ranchers own cattle and sheep that eat grass on the land. The BLM is in charge of huge areas of land across the United States.
But things are changing. China is growing richer. There are more jobs for young Chinese people. They often move to cities or countries far away.

Ma said that she looks to other old people for company. "We're like a big family," she said. "We can talk to each other and share our problems." Some are wondering why China's leaders made the law.
SHANGHAI " Grown-ups in China must visit their mothers and fathers. It's the law. If an old person feels their children don't come home enough, they can take their grown child to court. Grandparents are important in China.
She went back for a protest. Mateo and two other young people who came to the U.S. without permission went to the border. They asked for permission to come back into the U.S. There are about 11 million people living in the U.S. who were born elsewhere and came to the U.S. without permission.
But the government protected large, old trees. The owls liked to live in the trees. Logging slowed down a lot. Most lumber mills in the area closed.
The protesters included tribal elders and mothers with young children. There were also people who had come from other places to support the Indians. Together they slowed down the large group of trucks carrying the machine parts. They were not able to stop the trucks for long, though.
The road cuts through pine forests and runs along a winding river. Hundreds showed up along the narrow highway on Monday and Tuesday. Together they formed a barricade " a human wall that blocked the road. They were attempting to stop a huge load of machine parts going to Alberta, Canada.
The shock had muddled up the minerals inside. The result was something like shaking up a sealed box of chocolates. "It looks good on the outside, but all the pieces are ... [broken up] on the inside," Schmitt said. The study also shows that the shergottites weren't old rocks, Humayun said.
The struggle must continue until "all are treated equally and fairly in the eyes of the law." Many people around the Lincoln Memorial wore T-shirts or buttons. Some carried signs with Trayvon Martin's picture. George Zimmerman was found not guilty in the shooting death of the Florida teenager.
HOPE MILLS, N.C. " Alberta Currie's great-grandparents were slaves. She was born 78 years ago in a farmhouse in the middle of tobacco and cotton fields.
Three civil rights groups have filed lawsuits in North Carolina. They say that the law is unfair to African-Americans. One group says the new law is like the taxes black voters had to pay in the South years ago. Those taxes were part of the Jim Crow laws.
Some of the money will go to helping poor people. How will the tax affect Mexicans? They would pay an extra peso for each liter of sugary drinks they buy. A peso is about 8 cents.
The woman is missing. Officials assume she is dead. It began raining on Monday. By Wednesday the rainfall had set records.

The new panels would be better at harvesting energy than the silicon panels. The new panels would be less expensive, too, the researchers said. The new material contains elements called potassium, niobium, barium, and nickel. There are a lot of those elements around.
Scientists have known about materials with polarity for many years. But those materials absorb energy from the wrong type of light. So they have not been used to make solar panels. The Penn-Drexel team started with a material with polarity.
It is called potassium niobate. Then the team added barium and nickel. Those elements let the material absorb energy from the right kind of light. "The nickel is really doing the job," Anthony M. Rappe said.
In America, there are a lot of jobs for low-skilled workers. There are jobs for people who went to college. There are not enough jobs for people in between. Fast-food workers are suffering for the same reasons that most workers are.
There are not enough jobs for people in between. Fast-food workers are suffering for the same reasons that most workers are. They have been making less and less money over the years. The government wrote the rules of how companies can work.
The very richest Americans are making much more money than they did 30 years ago. They are not getting richer because of changes in technology or because they have the most needed skills. They are making more money because the rules have changed. If pay had gone up since 1968 the way it did for many years before then, the lowest wage someone could take home would be $17 an hour today, not a measly $7.25.
Kelley said the new rules would "increase the protection of eagles and will help develop more wind farms." He said wind farms are important. They can help stop climate change. Climate change is a shift in weather patterns.
He said wind farms are important. They can help stop climate change. Climate change is a shift in weather patterns. It's thought to be caused in part by humans burning fuels.
Birds And Bats Kelley, from the American Wind Energy Association, said that wind farms hadn't had a big effect on bald eagles. He said that only a tiny amount of the golden eagles killed by humans died because of wind farms. The population of golden eagles in the West isn't going down, he said.
The U.S. needs a large fleet of quality carriers. Otherwise, the U.S. Navy may not be able to continue to secure the seas and shipping routes around the globe much longer. The U.S. has built new carriers that are an important step toward a better fleet. The first is the USS Gerald R. Ford.
And they have gear that can slow down planes when they land. That will allow them to operate planes heavily loaded with weapons and fuel. It also has a larger flight deck. And it has improved elevators to move missiles from below the deck to the surface.
WASHINGTON " Some people say aircraft carriers aren't as useful anymore. Aircraft carriers are giant ships that can hold many planes. They have a long deck that planes can use to take off and land.
Aircraft carriers face new risks as other countries get stronger. But, the answer is not to give up. Instead, the United States needs to make better use of its technology. New advances in technology could make carriers last longer.
But, the answer is not to give up. Instead, the United States needs to make better use of its technology. New advances in technology could make carriers last longer. New inventions can shoot energy or lasers, instead of missiles.
Jellyfish are not really fish. They are animals without a backbone. And they don't swim like fish.
They are mostly made up of water. They have just a small amount of stuff that's a bit like jelly. And jellyfish don't have bones. Their simple bodies look like an open umbrella or a bell.
Others can be less than an inch wide. The jellyfish robot 8 centimeters and weighs just 2 grams. It has four flapping wings that look like flower petals. The robot moves more like a moth than a jellyfish.
ARIVACA, Ariz. " Many people die each year trying to come into the U.S. from Mexico. They're hungry and thirsty from crossing the border.

In America, there is a big difference between how much money the ultra-rich have and how much money the poor have. Obama wants to make this difference smaller.
So they can tell if the water changes. It is hard to see the animals' behavior because they tend to hide in the water or under rocks,  Joel Snodgrass, a biology professor, said. The new study helped fix this problem. Scientists looked at lots of places.
A recent study said the large source of underground water farmers use for irrigation was being used up too fast. This was happening even when wet years followed dry ones. Such a source of underground water is called an aquifer. Nearly half a million acres of land are devoted to wine grapes in California.
Dancers from two of the world's oldest ballet companies performed. The faces of Russian writers through the ages were displayed on enormous screens. Athletes said goodbye to other athletes from far-off places. Some looked ahead to the 2018 Winter Games.
Russia!" Fireworks exploded above them. The  show presented a stunning overview of Russian history. The closing ceremony started at 20:14 Sochi time.
They have also been put in places where silver has never been before. Some fear the nanoparticles' small size may cause health problems. They also fear that it could hurt the ecosystem. Studies have found that nanosilver and other nanoparticles can spread all over the body.
And millions of people are on Facebook. Scientists studied more than one billion Facebook posts. They discovered that when a person wrote a happy post, their friends also wrote happy posts. When a person wrote a sad or angry post, their friends wrote sad or angry posts.
A new study says that people spread their joy on Facebook. Facebook is a popular social networking website. People also pass on their sadness. This may be important.
But things have changed. Today, bullfighting is disappearing. Some people protest at bullfights. They are against the killing of the bulls.
Clinton eventually chose an area of downtown Little Rock near the Arkansas River. Rutherford said the site has helped spread wealth around the whole city. The area now attracts more than 300,000 visitors a year. Aside from the library, it has other attractions such as museums and theaters.
People who live there are hoping that will change. They hope that President Barack Obama will build his presidential library in their area. Each president traditionally builds a presidential library after leaving the White House. It is more than a normal library.
Congressman Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania is pushing for a new law. If passed, help would be easier to get and be set up through a child's regular doctor. Violent acts in schools do not just happen, Murphy said. Many had "been developing over a long period of time."

They get the social media talk. It's about more than being polite. St. Paul's coach, Steve Mask, warns players about what not to do. He tells them not to write about injuries.
Players who get hurt might not be as good after they heal. Colleges looking for athletes want to make sure their players can win. Promising to play for a college on Twitter is also a bad idea. High school athletes sometimes have big decisions to make.
He said that posting bad things about women or writing messages about drug use is a problem. Online bullying is bad, too. David Cutcliffe coaches the football team at Duke University. He said he decided not to take on a high school player this year.
There are fewer chances to meet face to face. Social media help coaches get more information during recruiting. Bret Bielema coaches football at Arkansas. Social media are now a part of what he looks at with high school players.
Everyone online can read what they say. Sometimes people say things that are inappropriate. They might write something offensive or use bad language. Some players are being punished for what they say on Twitter.
China has a Communist government. That means it is very strict and wants its people to believe that it is a good way to live. Many people in China are worried that the new SAT could make American ideas more popular in China. Imagine a Chinese student taking the new SAT.

In the spring of 2012, Emily was close to death. She was just 6 years old. Emily was suffering from leukemia, a form of cancer. Emily's parents were desperate to save their only child.
The body needs T-cells for its immune system. The immune system keeps the body from getting sick. After doctors removed Emily's T-cells, they started to infect them. They treated them with a disabled form of the HIV virus.
They treated them with a disabled form of the HIV virus. HIV causes AIDS, which is a deadly disease. The virus doctors injected into Emily was not the normal HIV virus. Scientists and doctors had made changes to it.
Scientists and doctors had made changes to it. The virus could no longer cause disease. Instead, it now had the power to attack cancer cells. The virus targeted Emily's cancer cells.
That means that the NIH will no longer be able to give as much money to hospitals for scientific work. Peter Grollman is worried. He works at the hospital where Emily was treated. Less government money could mean less experimental therapies and research.
Their goal is to make lawmakers aware of the important studies being done at children's hospitals across the county. It's important for the Whiteheads. Last year Emily's life was saved in one of those hospitals. They want politicians to know that doctors are making life-saving discoveries at children's hospitals across the country.
