Cushing fought for the North. He died at age 22 during the Battle of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania. Cushing was hit twice. However, he refused to leave his cannon. Badly wounded, he fought for two hours until he was killed. Cushing was awarded the medal because of Margaret Zerwekh. She learned about him after moving to the Cushing family home in Wisconsin. Zerwekh read about Cushing's heroism and felt he deserved the Medal of Honor.
This fear is keeping many of them away. Too few of them are coming to care for patients, the WHO said. People who come down with Ebola run a fever. They feel weak and have muscle pain and headaches. There is no cure. Sierra Leone is next to Liberia. A WHO doctor there has become sick with Ebola. The doctor will be sent to another hospital to be treated, the WHO said.
They hold up three fingers to protest against it. The books and the movies are very popular. Thailand was hit by protests in 2013. Some protesters said the government was dishonest and should go. Thailand's army took over running the country in May 2014. It removed the leaders who the people had voted for. The army said it had to bring order after months of protests. The army has banned groups of more than five people.
They said its genes were too much like the genes of other giraffes. All plants and animals have genes. They play a big part in what animals and plants look and act like. Genes are passed down from parents. If an animal species' genes are too alike, it can be more likely to become sick or have certain flaws. The animal species may become weaker. It might not be able to change with its environment. For example, a disease could spread among giraffes.
Imagine a school that starts at 8 a.m. every morning. If it started at 9 a.m. instead, students could get an extra hour of sleep each night. This could help students feel rested. It may have other benefits as well. Some may even do better work in school because they are not so tired. This is why some doctors think that starting school later is a good idea. Will there be enough time for classes if the school day starts later? Will parents be able to get their kids ready for school before going to work?
Police have arrested Frazier Glenn Miller, 73. He's believed to be the shooter. Civil rights groups say Miller has ties to the Ku Klux Klan. The Klan is a hate group. Miller has said hateful things against Jews and others. Police do not think that Miller knew his three victims. Obama asked the religious leaders to fight religious hate, including anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism is prejudice against Jews.
WASHINGTON – At least four people died in Midwest floods this Spring. But the death toll could have been higher. Forecasters said more people could have died if there were no river gauges. It sits in the water. The United States has 8,000 gauges to quickly track the rise of rivers. But that number may shrink. The reason is that lawmakers in Washington are in the middle of a fight.
WASHINGTON – At least four people died in Midwest floods this Spring. But the death toll could have been higher. Forecasters said more people could have died if there were no river gauges. A gauge is a kind of measuring stick. The United States has 8,000 gauges to quickly track the rise of rivers. But that number may shrink. The reason is that lawmakers in Washington are in the middle of a fight. They cannot agree over how much money the government should spend.
And they are based on new, mostly larger serving sizes. These reflect how people really eat. The changes are meant to help in the fight against some serious health problems. Among these are obesity. Far too many Americans are obese. The public will be allowed to comment on the planned changes. Final rules for the new labels will be released within a year. Government officials believe the new labels will be helpful.
"I'm absolutely disgusted by it, but this is how our system works," said Luo, a math teacher. Luo is fighting hard to change things. The Chinese government has also started speaking out against overly expensive gifts. Such gifts are often really bribes. It is against the law both to give and to take bribes. When government officials take bribes for favors, it is called corruption. "Gift-giving is a must, but you should avoid extravagance," the government newspaper declared. It warned against certain kinds of gifts: luxury brands, wine, expensive cigarettes, and large amounts of cash.
BERLIN " If you think U.S. lawmakers behaved badly during the government shutdown, you are not alone. But one German newspaper writer asked why. After all, people in Germany had seen this sort of thing before. The Republicans insisted on cutting back the healthcare law. That led to the shutdown.
The Pasadena meters did not cost the city money. They were designed by college students. They were paid for by money that companies gave to the city, Huang said. City leaders say the money collected by the meters might help in finding people homes. The number of homeless people in Pasadena has decreased by one-half in the last three years.
Barnett made big changes at Capitol Records. He picked different artists. He signed two of the biggest acts of last year, Sam Smith and 5 Seconds of Summer. Record companies have to sign contracts with musicians and artists to record their albums. The 2015 Grammy awards were good to Capitol Records' artists. Their musicians got 46 nominations. Smith got six nominations for his first album and was nominated in the top four awards: best record, album, song and new artist. Capitol had been hurt by changes in the music business over the years.
WASHINGTON " The United States closed embassies in several Muslim countries over the weekend. The government made the decision after getting information about a possible attack. The U.S. also warned travelers about the threat. The embassies are where the official U.S. representative to a country works. The closings are only for a few days. It was not clear how the government found out about the threat. But congressmen went on television Sunday to argue about it. Some said it proved that the government is right to spy on people's cellphone and Internet information.
People started looking at two NSA programs after Edward Snowden told reporters about what the agency was doing. He used to do work for the NSA. The programs had been secret. A secret court said collecting cellphone records was allowed. A second program comes under a separate law. Under that program, the NSA collects information on Internet traffic on sites like Facebook and Yahoo. Some people do not like the government looking at information about their phone calls or how they use the Internet. They think the information should be private.
The metal suit the Army wants would certainly be awe-inspiring. Bullets would bounce off it harmlessly. It would be able to download live video. These would come from remote-controlled airplanes, or drones, flying overhead. Tiny motors in the exoskeleton would give the soldier extra strength. He'd be able to easily run and jump while carrying 100 or more pounds. The suit would also be able to treat small wounds. It would carry a built-in oxygen supply in case of poison gas.
They were teammates. But that did not mean the football players got along. People who know Martin say that Incognito bullied the younger player. Dolphins coach Joe Philbin suspended Incognito from the team. It could affect adults where they work, too. Incognito sent threatening text messages to his teammate, two people familiar with the situation said Monday. The messages were also racist, they said. The people spoke to The Associated Press.
It also has a high amount of smoking for a big city, according to a health department report. In Philadelphia, smoking is more common among the poor than people who aren't poor, said Giridhar Mallya. He works for the Philadelphia Department of Public Health. Being poor can be very hard on a person's mind. People with more money can afford to get counseling for their problems. The poor cannot, so they smoke to help themselves deal with their distress, Mallya said. The poor may also smoke more because they often live in places with no grocery stores. Instead, they shop at corner stores.
That's what former government official Bo Xilai got. Bo was recently sentenced to life in prison for accepting bribes. China's population is enormous. Battles for education, health care, jobs and promotions can be tough. Luo said that his family paid doctors around $16,000 when his grandfather needed an operation. They did this even though health insurance supposedly paid for the operation. Health insurance is bought in advance to pay for costs if a person gets sick. Parents in his town have to pay at least $3,200 to move their child to a better school, he said.
Marine mammals are warm-blooded creatures that live in the sea. The overall success of solar tags is not yet know. That's because solar tags have not been around for very long. But so far scientists have not run into serious problems. The tags record how deep the fish go. They measure the temperature of the water the sharks swim in. That information is all useful to scientists. Mahmood Shivji works at a college in Florida.
A court in San Francisco became the first in the country to decide this Tuesday. Until now, gay people could be kept off some juries just because they were gay. A gay person is attracted to a person of his or her own sex. The decision by the three judges on the court was unanimous. They sit on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The decision came out of a 2011 fight between two companies that make medicine. A lawyer for one of them prevented a gay man from being on the jury without a good reason.
And the school's Viking mascot high-fived his way across the room. These fifth-graders are at an important turning point. How they see see themselves " as smart or stupid " may decide if they go to college. Western University wants to convince them that college is in their future. Not many Whatcom County high school graduates go to college. The number is lower than the state average. And the Washington state average is low to begin with. Less than 1 in 4 high school graduates in two districts there go to four-year universities.
The slippery slope of a possible ban doesn't stop at the state level. The Fantasy Sports Trade Association was recently warned that popular sports fantasy leagues could be banned by this legislation as well. Fantasy sports teams are created by choosing your favorite players from a sport like baseball and creating a made-up "team." Fantasy football is very popular. It wouldn't be surprising if other forms of popular online gaming were prohibited by the government too. Facebook and other social media feature games that might be regulated. Americans are well known for their ability to start businesses from scratch. Innovators like Henry Ford, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and others are as tied to American history as U.S. presidents.
Some feel people should still be told to swim parallel to shore. Others feel they should be told to float and wait. The "float and wait" approach does have its dangers. In a handful of cases, swimmers would be forced into deeper water. Meanwhile, beachgoers should keep a simple tip in mind: If you spot a rip current, play it safe. Swim near a lifeguard or don't go in the water past your knees.
He blamed Ukraine's new leaders for the takeover. He called them names -- "nationalists, Russophobes and anti-Semites." A Ukrainian nationalist is a patriot. A Russophobe is anti-Russian. In February, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych fled Ukraine. He left after angry protests against his government. Many people were killed. Late last month, Russian soldiers marched into Crimea.
Year-round direct sunlight keeps the climate steadily warm. The study shows that the tropics have helped other parts of the world get a wider range of living creatures. An ecosystem includes all living and non-living things existing together in a certain place. For example, a desert is an ecosystem. Tropical ecosystems have many different kinds of animals. That makes them diverse. Ecosystems in colder areas of the world are not as diverse since they have fewer types of species. But scientists haven't agreed on why this is.
A tortoise can live 160 years. "It's heartbreaking that it's come to this. But it's the right thing to do," Gibbons said. He is in charge of the Turtle Conservancy in California. "We've (spoiled) her natural beauty," Gibbons said. The ploughshare tortoise is one of the rarest tortoises on Earth. It is against the law to buy and sell them. The Conservancy wants to mark all 360 ploughshares in the world.
But he also spoke about his own personal story. He was once a young boy with a mother who struggled to make ends meet. Obama told a story about a child's chances in the United States. He talked about a child born into one of the poorest families in America. She is 10 times more likely to stay where she is. In other countries like Canada, Germany and France, she has a better chance of not staying poor. Republican John Boehner blamed Democrats and Obama for the growing numbers of poor people. He said they were the reason for there not being any laws to create jobs.
He helped make the app. Ma said the problem is that the government does not force companies to follow the law. In China, there is no democracy. The government is not elected by the people. People don't have many ways to force the government to change. Ma hopes the app will help. Through the app, people will learn about the level of pollution. Ma hopes they will grow angry enough to push the government to clean up the air.
Nine of the survivors of the battleship attack are alive. Four of them came together again in Hawaii. Every year on the day of the attack, the men gather in Pearl Harbor. They come to mark the event. The survivors are now in their 90s. Still, they promised that this year's reunion won't be their last. The men gathered on Tuesday near a memorial for the Arizona. The memorial sits on top of the sunken battleship.
Anne Meylan is a scientist. "We do not know why the numbers went down. And we do not know why they are coming back," she said. In the early 2000s, many turtles were being killed. These companies killed turtles while catching fish. Over time, these companies found ways to stop killing turtles. Many loggerheads died because of other problems. But these problems were not in Florida.
Their hot breath is not good for the paintings. Chinese and American scientists have been working together to protect the caves for more than 20 years. They made a long-term plan to protect these caves. The first step is to examine the caves closely. Then they can figure out what might damage the cave paintings. They found that sand and hot air are dangers here. The scientists have put doors on the caves to keep hot air out. They are also limiting the number of people that can visit each day.
Archaeologists have discovered that the paintings date back 40,000 years. They were able to prove that art did not begin only in Europe. The paintings were first found in caves on Sulawesi in the 1950s. Sulawesi is an island in the Southwest Asian country of Indonesia. Until now, archaeologists never tried to figure out how old they really were. The job of an archaeologist is to study how humans lived a long time ago. The discovery was published this week in the journal Science. For many years, archaeologists thought ancient humans painted the pictures about 10,000 years ago.
The protests are also unfair to community members. They want "to feel safe in their own homes," Nixon said. On Sunday, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder ordered that doctors look at Brown's body. Holder is in charge of the federal government's Justice Department. A doctor who was asked by Brown's family to examine the body found that the teen was shot six times. Another doctor exam was ordered by the state. It is not known what the state's doctors found. As night fell in Ferguson Sunday, a protest became violent.
Reporters and photographers watched. The big cat crept out of the cage. He looked around, and then ran off down a dirt road. The panther disappeared into the forest. They had raised the orphan cat for 18 months. The heartwarming moment was shown in newspapers and on TV. Nine months later, the panther was dead. Rescued male panthers often die after their release.
But the hate hardly ended after World War II. Romani Rose is head of a Roma group in Germany. He said hate toward Roma people remains widespread there. His people still suffer unfair and insulting treatment, he said. They are also the first to be fired. He said that when poor Romani villagers come to Berlin, they find only overcrowded apartments. Crooked landlords overcharge them for nothing but a mattress on the floor. Cordula Simon is a Berlin government official.
The Nobel Pirze is 112 years old. Munro is the 13th female literature winner. Munro grew up in Wingham, a traditional Canadian town west of Toronto. She tended to write about her experience there and her life after the social revolution of the 1960s. She was born Alice Anne Laidlaw. Her parents were a fox farmer and a teacher. She liked to read in a town that didn't. Munro hid her goals like they were forbidden.
Even without that information, the government is coming up with ideas to help protect the animals. These include planting new trees. There may also be some logging. The idea is to save certain species from being wiped out. Federal wildlife biologists could not work during the government shutdown. The blaze also looks like it hit dozens of areas where spotted owls and great grey owls nest. Great grey owls are the largest owls in North America. They are 2 feet tall and have a 5-foot wingspan.
They thought his lack of an education would limit him. By mid-May, the sisters were well on their way to work permits and driver's licenses. And his wife, Maria, was inspired to get her GED. The general educational development (GED) is equal to a high school diploma. Benito's path is more uncertain. He has not yet registered at the adult school. It is hard to find the time for classes after a 10-hour workday. He operates tractors and other heavy machinery for his job in the grape fields.
The Giron brothers left Honduras in February 2013. They traveled in a car with a guide and five other teens ages 13 to 16. It took the group 11 days to travel from Honduras to the United States. They traveled all the way north through Mexico until they reached the Rio Grande River. At the border, the guide put the Girons and other teens on a small raft. He paddled them across the river to Texas. Once they were in the United States, their guide left the teens by themselves. He told them to keep walking until they were found by police.
They were trained to obey. Over time, they became very good at "reading" what humans are thinking and feeling. They pick up signals from our voices, and from the way we move our bodies, hands, and eyes. Cats, on the other hand, pretty much developed on their own. Let's face it. Cats view humans as big, clumsy cats. They treat us the same way they treat each other. The truth is, cats live to be served and adored.
The new serving size for soda will have to be at least 12 ounces. There will be an increase for some other products, such as ice cream. "The serving sizes for many foods are a joke now," said Jacobson. Look at "the half-cup of ice cream" or "2-ounce muffins and bagels." Some packaged foods and drinks are usually finished all at once. These will be scored differently on the new labels. Nutrition information will be given for the entire package, not just the serving size. This would be the case, for example, with a 20-ounce soda bottle.
"The serving sizes for many foods are a joke now," said Jacobson. Look at "the half-cup of ice cream" or "2-ounce muffins and bagels." Few people eat that little at one time. Some packaged foods and drinks are usually finished all at once. Nutrition information will be given for the entire package, not just the serving size. This would be the case, for example, with a 20-ounce soda bottle. There will also be new rules for another kind of food or drink: a food package that is two times the serving size and could be finished all at once. For example, a 24-ounce soda bottle would contain two servings of 12 ounces.
"It's the closest thing we have to Martians." The scientists planned to load bits of the bacteria into a DNA sequencer. This sequencer will show them the order of four repeating nucleotides, or chemical "letters," found in the bacteria. That order or sequence of "letters" makes up the bacteria's DNA. Once found, the bacteria's DNA sequence will be uploaded. Scientists at Venter's company, Synthetic Genomics, will then download the sequence. In the Mojave, all this work is taking place in a huge trailer. And it needs a team of scientists.
Twenty-six students from different backgrounds took part in the program. The program is based at the University of Washington. Its goal is to get people of different races and family backgrounds to work in conservation. Okwu, for instance, is black. They help save rivers, forests and animals. Conservationists work at the National Park Service and the U.S. Forest Service. They also work for private groups to protect endangered animals like whales or sea turtles. Most people working in conservation are white.
Usually, they were used books that cost just 5 cents. Billington is 85 years old. Even so, he does not plan to stop working anytime soon. He hopes to keep making it easier for people to use the library's huge collection. It is his duty to protect, preserve and share American art and history.
They also asked how she would wear her hair. Serova ignored the makeup question. As for her hair, she said: "Why don't you ask the question about Alexander's hair?" Crewmate Alexander Samokutyaev was seated next to her. The women will spend six months aboard the space station. It is 260 miles above Earth. The space station has been orbiting around the Earth for 16 years. In the United States, scientists are studying the differences between men and women in space.
She said many were moved to new housing. Others got money from the city to leave their homes, she added. However, many deny those claims. They say the people of Favela do Metro were given very little time to leave. For those who remain in Favela do Metro, things are only getting worse. Thirty-eight-year-old Barbara Cabral Souza is still there. She says the city still hasn't offered her a way out. The shops and jobs that were once here are gone.
Basnet led a Nepali women's team up Everest. At first, few women wanted to become guides. They didn't want to leave their homes for many days. "Some thought it was against our culture," said Nicky, the youngest sister. "Women are expected to be at home doing household work." But soon the word spread. The women liked earning their own money, Nicky said. They didn't like depending on their husbands.
Who is the first person you think of when you hear the word genius? For many people, the answer would be physicist Albert Einstein. Now it turns out there was something special about his brain: He had an enormous corpus callosum. The corpus callosum is made up of neural fibers. But instead of electricity, they carry messages from the brain. The corpus callosum runs the length of the brain, right down the middle. It carries electrical signals between the brain's two halves. These are known as cerebral hemispheres.
Parents also did not know that entering their password started a 15-minute clock. During this time, kids could buy things without having to enter the password again. Apple also agreed to change the way it bills customers. It will let people know when someone buys something on a game or app. He said the company gave in to the FTC. The agreement does not ask Apple "to do anything we weren't already going to do." So, the company decided to accept it instead of starting a long fight with the FTC. Apple's store is a "safe place" for all its customers, he said.
They also want to stay in touch with Rodrigo. They thought that a video game called Minecraft would help them do that. Rodrigo and his classmates used to play Minecraft at each other's houses. Players have to work together to build things. The Internet allowed the California fourth-graders to play Minecraft with Rodrigo in his new home in Mexico. The game made it seem as if Rodrigo was still next to them. It did not feel like he was playing from thousands of miles away. The kids were able to come up with their own rules.
The agreement is a remarkable event in Syria's civil war. More than 100,000 people from both sides have been killed during the war. A total of 6.5 million people have been forced from their homes in the past 30 months. There also seemed to be no way the United States and Russia could agree about how the conflict should be resolved. Only two weeks ago, the United States appeared to be just hours away from sending missiles into Syria. The attack was going to be punishment for a supposed Aug. 21 poison gas attack that killed hundreds of people. Russia was defending Syria. It insisted that the rebels were responsible for the gas attack.
Rescue crews swarmed into the ruins at Plaza Towers Elementary School. There were 75 students and staff in the building when the storm struck. Helicopters were banned from flying over the school, CNN reported. Rescuers feared engine noise would make it hard to hear cries for help. Briarwood Elementary School in Oklahoma City was also hit by the tornado. News reports said the twister shot cars through the front of the building. Oklahoma often has tornadoes. But even lifelong residents were shocked by Monday's storm.
The storms caused the river levels to rise. And the fight over the extra water was on. "This is a big one," said Les Grober. He is with the Water Resources Control Board. "We get many issues before us. But this is a very dry year. People are very worried." People are very concerned about their communities, said Janet McCleery.
Some people, though, say TNR is mean. Life on the streets is hard for cats, they say. Homeless cats are often killed by animals or cruel humans. The cats shouldn't be put back on the streets, they say. That idea makes some people very angry. Cats have a right to live, they say. There's one big reason some people don't like cats living on the streets: They kill a lot of birds. Some studies say more than a billion birds get killed by cats each year.
No two days in a row end at the same time. And moms and dads feel cheated. Many have arranged their workweeks to spend Wednesdays with their kids. Some children do attend church school. They have found Wednesdays useful. That's when they have their kids' music lessons, sports practice and other non-school activities. These don't get much attention in the French education system. Isabelle helped put together a letter with people in her rich neighborhood.
But it depends what kind of floor it is. Bacteria were more likely to move from tile floors to food. Bacteria were less likely to move from carpets to food. Other scientists also tested food from the floor. They tested for another bacteria. The bacteria is called Salmonella. They found Salmonella move quickly from floors to food. Jeffrey T. LeJeune is a food safety expert.
Einstein's corpus callosum was much thicker than those of 15 men his age. Compared to 52 young men, it was thicker in five important spots. So Einstein's large corpus callosum may explain his genius. It may have helped the two sides of his brain communicate faster than usual. As people age, their brains usually get weaker. But this doesn't always happen if someone exercises their brain a lot by with activities that involve lots of thinking. Einstein's corpus callosum was in much better shape than those of the older men. It was a little more developed than those of the young men.
Spencer worked in Africa with the aid group Doctors Without Borders. He called the group on Thursday to report that he had a fever. City officials said Spencer did not have signs of Ebola until Thursday morning. He was not contagious when he was out in the city earlier in the week. Neighbors gathered outside Spencer's Harlem neighborhood apartment building. Health crews sealed his apartment. They handed out Ebola information in English and Spanish. Cleaners wearing protective suits and boots went into the apartment.
"It wouldn't fluke up," said Nancy Black, an ocean scientist. She was on board the Point Sur that day. Black was speaking of the tail flip that humpbacks perform before diving to feed. She also noticed several buoys were trailing behind it. Black called the U.S. Coast Guard. The whale was caught in a long line that connected to a crab trap. A rescue effort was started. Dozens of volunteers joined in.
Brown was a black teenager without a weapon who was shot by a white police officer. He was killed in August in Ferguson, Missouri, near St. Louis. The shooting set off nearly nightly protests and violence. The black community felt that Brown wouldn't have been killed if he was white. They introduced themselves to police and city officials. Late that night, they met with Brown's family. They sat in a police truck and talked. The peacemakers work for a little-known unit of the U.S. Department of Justice.
It's just happening in a much larger way. U.S. law protects people who have been mistreated, but it is not perfect. President Obama is trying to protect these children as best he can. People afraid of being hurt can ask for protection in the U.S. Our laws allow them the right to ask to stay here. They are given rights as refugees. Not every child should be allowed to stay. But just turning children away goes against our laws and our history.
SeaWorld will also study orcas in the ocean. It will have a team of scientists. The scientists will watch over SeaWorld's orcas. They will see if the orcas are happy. PETA a group that wants to protect animals. It makes sure people treat animals well. It does not like the new plans for the orcas. It wants the orcas to be put in the ocean.
Should kids play tackle football? Football is a rough game. Even though they wear helmets, they bang their heads. Their brains might get hurt. Some scientists think kids should wait until they turn 12 before they start playing. A new study came out on Wednesday.
PHILADELPHIA " Brian Daniels went to the border between Turkey and Syria this summer. His mission: to help protect Syria's history from the violence of civil war. Daniels taught 20 Syrian people how to protect museums during emergencies. He gave them supplies to protect important pottery and old books. He is an expert on preserving culture and history. Daniels said he was amazed at the bravery of the Syrian people. They know their lives are in danger, Daniels said. They feel it is their duty to save the things that are most precious to Syria's history.
They believe people should eat food that comes from plants. The scientists, though, say these new animals will feed the world. The government is spending millions of dollars on their studies. In about 35 years, there may be as many as 9 billion people on Earth. More people will mean a bigger need for meat. But farm animals don't do well in the heat. Heat makes chickens sick. Bad weather can kill herds of cows.
But there is one problem: gold. In India, gold is worn at weddings. But it is far more than just a nice thing to wear. It shows a person's importance. India buys one-fifth of the world's gold. But recently, buying gold has become much harder. The rupee, India's currency " that is, its money " is worth less than it used to be. This has made gold much more expensive for Indians.
The new Colorado laws said that guns should only hold 15 bullets at once. People who want to buy guns would also have to have a background check. Some gun owners and their supporters said that their opinions were ignored when the laws were made. Morse said he would continue to fight for gun control. Morse said that this was worth the sacrifice of losing his job. "It is a small price to pay," he said. Giron told her supporters that "this will make us stronger." She said that she has no regrets about voting for the laws.
The Internet helped Mark Zuckerberg start Facebook while still a college student. Earlier this week in California's Silicon Valley, he announced a big plan. Zuckerberg wants to try to bring the Internet to billions of poor people. It was his latest move to show he is a tech boss who can also tackle public issues. He's not the only rich CEO who thinks technology can change the world.
He loved to think of new ideas that would help businesses. He also hoped to start his own business. College would help him learn to do those things better. He wanted to go to school somewhere near New York City. Gray was a very good student in high school. He also led the local Bible club. Gray even started his own non-profit company, called Genesis. This company helped students to volunteer.
At least 68 people were killed and 175 wounded Saturday at the mall shooting. It was Kenya's worst terror attack in 15 years, said President Uhuru Kenyatta. A group from Somalia took responsibility for the attack. It is called the Shabab. They have links with al-Qaida. The Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks in the United States were committed by al-Qaida. The Shabab said the mall attack was payback. It was angry that Kenya sent troops to Somalia two years ago to try to control the Shabab.
"What are you going to do about it?" Obama asked about the innocent people who were poisoned. But not many countries support Obama's plan to fire missiles at Syria. At least not yet. They say this happened in the Iraq war. The United Nations is still testing samples from Syria. It plans to say if poison gas was used. But it won't say which sides used it.
That group was at high risk of being autistic themselves. And 51 babies who had no close relatives with autism were in the other group. They were thought to have a lower risk of having autism. That group was used as a control. The babies were shown scenes of caregiving, such as being fed or getting bathed. At the same time, the scientists tracked their eyes. They wanted to see where the babies were looking. They measured the amount of time babies looked at the caregiver's eyes, mouth, body and things nearby.
He said the United States and Iran can "turn threats into opportunities." But he also has condemned U.S. "military interference." He insisted that Iran's nuclear program is something it will not surrender. Analysts say Obama must be careful not to look too eager to make a deal. It would also make important members of Congress upset. Israelis would not like it, either. They are counting on the United States to prevent Iran from ever getting a nuclear bomb. Ben Rhodes works for Obama.
They don't agree about the civil war in Syria. Russia also decided to stop U.S. citizens from adopting Russian children. The United States is upset with Russia because of possible human rights violations. Obama also has criticized a new law in Russia that is called unfair to gays and lesbians. One is that the United States has set up a missile shield in Eastern Europe. This was done to block Russia from Europe, Moscow says. Snowden gave secrets to reporters about government programs that gather information. These programs involve calls people make on their cellphones and how they use the Internet.
They behave better and are more involved. He saw the change himself visiting classrooms in Buffalo, New York. Smaller, quieter classes may have their biggest effect on kids who do not pay attention and try to avoid looking the teacher in the eye. That's because they cannot hide. Wouldn't smaller class sizes work even better if teachers changed what they do, too? That is the question Elizabeth Graue and her coworkers at the University of Wisconsin have been studying. They have been looking at schools involved in a project called SAGE. The SAGE program began in 1996.
The story she read said Florida needs more bees. Many bees have gotten sick. Some have died in bad weather. Other bees have been killed by accident. They don't want bugs to eat the crops. The poison kills the bugs. But it kills the bees, too. Farmers do not want to hurt the bees.
An encyclopedia has information about many different things. It includes articles on topics like animals, science, countries and famous people. Salesmen used to go to houses and knock on doors selling Encyclopaedia Britannica. A set could include 32 books. They thought Britannica was the best encyclopedia. More than two years ago, the company stopped publishing the books. It put the whole encyclopedia on the Internet. However, Britannica online is not as popular as Wikipedia.
She knew that at anytime she could be sent back to Honduras. Now, she doesn't have to look over her shoulder all the time. The government is letting some people who came here illegally before age 16 stay, at least for the time being. Navarro still cannot start the process to become a citizen. "It definitely feels different," said Navarro. She is now 23 and lives in North Philadelphia. "Now, we don't have to watch our backs. We can live with our parents, and (the government) can't deport us."
A black box record pilots' conversations. It also records information about the flight such as how fast it was flying. The search team is in a race against time. The black box's battery will last only 30 to 45 days. The odds of finding it in time are low. Searchers will need to find pieces of the plane. Hopefully, that will lead them to the black box. Based on the plane's flight path, investigators guess it crashed into the Indian Ocean.
While they avoid getting eaten, the male and the masculine-colored female are still at risk. For a long time, biologists have studied how animals try to look like other animals. It teaches them a lot about natural selection. Natural selection is sometimes called "survival of the fittest." Changes can help the animals hide from their enemies. They can also change to eat different foods or become better at hunting. Animals that cannot change might get eaten or die out. However, these animals cannot change on their own.
A new government study supports her claim. It found that black students were more than three times as likely as whites to be kicked out or suspended. And what about cases where the police were called? More than half the time the students were black or Hispanic. The study showed that too many public school students in Texas were being severely punished. Nearly 6 in 10 had been suspended or expelled during middle school or high school. These findings have led to changes around the country. The Buffalo, New York, school district is one example.
He sells the urchins to sushi restaurants. Steele heard about the sea getting more acidic. He saw right away what it could mean for his business and the ocean he loves. So Steele told Hofmann about the urchins. Her first experiment was putting baby urchins in water with lots of carbon dioxide. Hofmann found that the babies often got smaller in the water. Body size is very important for sea urchins. Bigger urchins can swim faster and get more food.
String instruments, like violins, violas and cellos, are tricky. They are some of the hardest instruments to keep in good working order. Before Cuba's 1959 revolution, many musicians played string instruments made in Europe. After the revolution, Cuba was cut off from doing business with many other countries. For many years, Russia provided Cuba with violins and cellos. These days, students must make do with inexpensive violins from China. But Chinese violins often pop strings or have other problems. Martinez and his helpers repair dozens of instruments a year.
Once collected, it can be sent to zoos all over the world. Theison said he hopes to pair a 14-year-old female with a possible mate this year. At his zoo, elephants roam over a huge amount of land. Few visitors bother them.
They also think it is wrong to force her to perform in shows. The government is still not sure if releasing captive whales is a good idea. It worries about the spread of disease. It also worries that newly released orcas will not be able to find food on their own. Other attempts to release captive orcas were unsuccessful. Some freed orcas died. Garrett said things would be different if Lolita was freed. She would first be taken to a netted-off area of the bay.
The Asian-American newcomers also mean new voters in the South. Almost three times as many Asian-Americans voted in Virginia in 2012, compared with 2004. There are many reasons for the population shift. Many different groups of Asian-Americans are moving to the South. The government tracks 23 different ethnic groups that it considers Asian-American. It's hard to find one explanation for the changes. Marita Etcubanez works for an Asian-American group. She says many move to the South to find better jobs.
LOS ANGELES " Kids love pizza. But pizza is making kids fat. Children are fatter now then they were in the past. They wanted to know if pizza is to blame. They looked at pizza because so many kids eat it. The professors talked to thousands of children. They asked them to make a list of everything they eat and drink in day.

Other symptoms are fever, red eyes and a runny nose. Measles can cause serious problems. Measles is spread by coughing and sneezing. It is very contagious. Doctors and scientists make a shot, or vaccine, that can keep people from getting measles. Most people get this when they are young. Today, some parents choose not to have their children get the measles shot. They are afraid the chemicals in the shot will hurt their kids.
Scrolls were the books back then. These handwritten scrolls come from a library in the town of Herculaneum. The town was one of those destroyed by the volcano. The scrolls were very badly burned by the volcano blast. In fact, it is very difficult to unroll them without destroying them. For that reason, many have never been unrolled. What is written inside remains a mystery. A new discovery may change all that.
The DNA studies show various things. Big cats split off from other cats about 11 million years ago. Then about 6 million years ago another big change occurred. Big cats split into several different species. But there's a problem: What scientists find by looking at big cat DNA doesn't agree with what the fossils tell them. Scientists are hoping to figure out where big cats first appeared. But the two kinds of evidence don't point to the same place. "If you only looked at the fossil, it would suggest Africa," Tseng said.
Big cats split into several different species. They became lions, tigers, jaguars and leopards. But there's a problem: What scientists find by looking at big cat DNA doesn't agree with what the fossils tell them. Scientists are hoping to figure out where big cats first appeared. "If you only looked at the fossil, it would suggest Africa," Tseng said. "If you only looked at DNA, it would suggest Asia." Scientists haven't been able to make the two kinds of evidence match up. Scientists hope the new fossils will solve this puzzle.
The newly found cat is probably part of a separate branch of the cat family, said Tseng. The modern snow leopard is most likely part of the same branch. Both are able to live high in the Tibetan mountains. Big cats present serious problems for paleontologists. But they didn't leave behind many fossils. So there are still many things we don't know about them. Scientists don't only study big cats by looking at their bones. They also look at their genes, or DNA.
Military lawyers said that Manning is a "traitor" for sending the secret papers to WikiLeaks. The Web site tries to stop governments and others from keeping secrets. Some of the information wound up in the hands of terrorists, the military said. Manning worked in intelligence in Iraq in 2009 and 2010. The papers included information about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. The Web site also showed combat videos from an army helicopter gunship. A TV news cameraman and his driver were killed during a shooting that was shown. So were other people.
HACKENSACK, N.J. " The hottest present this holiday season is a gadget both kids and adults can enjoy: a drone. Drones are small flying aircraft. They often have cameras attached. One popular drone this year is the Phantom 2 Vision. It has four propellers and a high-quality camera. It costs $1,200.
One half of Istanbul lies in Europe, while the other half sits in Asia. The city is connected by bridges across one of the busiest waterways on the planet, the Bosporus Strait. Istanbul is an important city for trade. Turkey is also one of the United States' closest friends in the region. Istanbul is a very modern city, but other parts of Turkey are less developed. Around 99 percent of Turks have a Muslim background. However, religion and politics are supposed to remain separate, just as they are in the U.S. Turkey's leader is Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
They did not need special skills or a college education to work there. Those factories are gone now. New companies have come that need skilled workers with more education. New Haven youth want those jobs, but they do not have the education or the skills. That is where New Haven Promise comes in. It will make a difference by paying for college. New Haven Promise is no one-way street. The students have to sign a pledge to "do their best."
"She does it one meal at a time." Last Monday, violent protests broke out again in Ferguson. A grand jury decided not to charge the officer who shot Brown. A grand jury is made up of a group of people. If Wilson was charged with a crime, he would have to go to court. On Thanksgiving, the city of Ferguson seemed to stop and take a deep breath. The protesters stopped to eat their own Thanksgiving dinners. The holiday was cold and quiet, at least for a few hours.
Disney had been trying to stop the ad planes for years. Michael P. Huerta is the leader of the FAA. Huerta told Congress that he would like to end the no-fly zones over Disney. Defenders of the no-fly zones say the Disney parks deserve special protection. They also attract large crowds. If airplanes could fly over Disney, there could be terror attacks. Others say the no-fly zones could not stop a terror attack. They think the law mostly hurts pilots who tow the ad banners.
People protesting want answers about how this young man died. They question the fairness of our police. I'm the top law enforcement officer and lawyer for the government. I run the Justice Department. The people of Ferguson can be sure of that. A fair and complete investigation will happen. On Wednesday, I was in Ferguson. I was there to be filled in on the civil rights investigation that I launched over a week ago.
UNITED NATIONS " "To be, or not to be, that is the question." The famous speech from Shakespeare's "Hamlet" will soon be heard all over the world. A group of actors from London hope to perform the play in every country and territory in the world. This week, the actors performed at the United Nations in New York City. Top diplomats gave the show a standing ovation. "It's an absolute delight to be here. It feels very, very odd," said Dominic Dromgoole, the show's director.
In January, U.S. District Judge Callie Granade struck down Alabama's gay marriage ban. The federal judge said the state ban goes against the U.S. Constitution. The Constitution lists laws that govern the whole country. Granade ordered that the state ban on gay marriage be removed. Groups who want to keep the ban went to the country's highest court, the Supreme Court of the United States. They asked the Supreme Court to stop Judge Granade's order. On Monday, the Supreme Court said it would not stop Granade's order. Gay people in Alabama may now get married.
Some people are talking about it even more than they are talking about Sunday's Super Bowl game. Belichick complained that trying to explain what happened has taken up a lot of time. Instead of preparing for the Super Bowl, he has had to answer questions about the deflated footballs. The NFL is looking into the matter. Either way, the Patriots will play in the Super Bowl this Sunday. And the NFL will make sure that all of the footballs are properly inflated.
They can't get in the way of airplanes. Also, people can't use them to spy on their neighbors. But drones mainly take pictures of nature. And they record historic moments, like the celebration of the Kings' hockey victory.
He said they had no place in the Sierra wilderness. Laura Pulido is a professor at USC. "He was a man of his times," she said. Many people in his time had prejudices. Muir worked to disgrace "California Indians by taking their lands." "But he also launched the environmental movement," she said. In Hannibal's view, "what counts is the number of acres protected."
England once ruled an empire all over the world because of its navy. Portsmouth has been important to English rulers since the 13th century. In 1511, shipbuilders there launched Henry VIII's ship Mary Rose. The ship was one of the first war vessels able to fire a broadside. The launch led to the rise of Britain as a naval powerhouse. The ship sank 34 years later during a fight with the French fleet. The wreck lay on the floor of the sea for nearly 300 years. Then a diver found it by accident.
It's also about jobs and money. "Without reefs, you don't have fish," said businessman Jeff Torode. "Without fish, you don't have divers." And "you don't have snorkelers." A lot less money for South Florida.
Russia also captured a Lithuanian fishing ship. Russia claimed that it had sailed into Russian waters. Even more troubling, Russia asked Lithuania to send 1,500 people who used to be Soviet citizens to Russia. Supposedly, they hadn't joined the military when they were young men in the Soviet Union. In mid-September, Russian nuclear bombers flew within 63 miles of Alaska and 46 miles of Canada. The action forced U.S. and Canadian jets to fly out in response. Russia is also upgrading its nuclear weapons with new missiles, submarines and a new bomber. Congress should vote to approve the $350 million for weapons to give to Ukraine.
WASHINGTON " Though they help run our country, our leaders in Washington can be amazingly clueless. They should see how the rest of the world sees us. Other nations watch and listen to whatever we say or do. The cluelessness of lawmakers explains why it released the torture report now. It has been 13 years since the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The report details the actions of the CIA. It is a spy agency that finds out information to prevent attacks on the U.S.
Cuba and the United States spoke secretly for a year about freeing him. Gross' family in Maryland said he is in bad health. He is weak and can barely walk. In Cuba, he had refused medical care, food and visits from American officials. The United States made a deal with Cuba. Gross will be released. In exchange, the United States will free three Cubans. The Cubans were arrested in 1998 for spying.
LOS ANGELES " Should you have to be a Christian to lead a Christian student group? InterVarsity Christian Fellowship is a Christian group for college students. The group requires that its leaders be Christians. As a result, it has gotten into a fight with Cal State and other universities. The disagreement at Cal State began when the university made a rule change.
They have built robots to cut lettuce. They have made computer software that can figure out how much grass to grow for cows to eat. Others companies are using technology to make products that taste like meat, cheese and eggs. Yet they are made from plants. It might mean less land is used to raise animals. Fewer trucks will be needed to transport the animals. So less gas will be used. It will mean less pollution.
The song played over and over the night her bones were found. Johanson is now the head of the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University. He spoke about how Lucy's discovery changed what scientists thought about early humans. He also discussed what he hopes to find next. The words are simpler and some definitions have been added._ I first began studying early humans at the beginning of the 1970s. At the time, most people thought humans came from Africa, but they became modern humans in Europe. She completely changed the idea of where we became human.
Pacelle is working with a group called Mainers for Fair Bear Hunting. They are leading the fight to change the hunting rules. On the other side is a group called Save Maine's Bear Hunt. It is fighting to keep the old ways of hunting. Maine's wildlife department even supports it. It says that Maine has more than 30,000 black bears. "We have one of the largest bear populations in the country, certainly on the East Coast," said James Cody. He helps run Save Maine's Bear Hunt.
