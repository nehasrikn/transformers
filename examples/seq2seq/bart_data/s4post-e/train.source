The rules can be fuzzy. The issue is heating up in several states with important Senate races. These include Alaska, Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana and New Hampshire. What happens in these races could decide which political party controls the Senate. They are called the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. Members of each party have more or less the same ideas about running the government. They also have similar goals, and usually vote the same way. The hometown question comes at a time when people really don't like politicians, which is another word for elected officials.
Congress is made up of people elected to vote on laws. Because they were fighting, fewer and fewer laws were being passed. Because of this, President Obama said his second term would be different. He would announce what he would do. He would use the executive power of the White House. After that, he would ask Congress to vote to make bigger changes. He also wants to get business leaders who have given money to these projects to ask Congress to act. "I'm going to ask every business leader to join us in this effort," the president said.
The change shows that women can do anything in the military, just like men. Combat roles can involve tanks, heavy weapons and ground fighting. They were previously off-limits to female troops. The jobs are tough and dangerous. Still, allowing women to serve in combat by itself cannot solve the headcount problem. Earning a spot in a combat unit is hard. Servicewomen will have to pass a very tough training course. They will need to be as fit as possible.
Nine of the sheep were pregnant. The park's new dwellers are big news: It's the first time bighorn sheep have been in this part of the mountain range in more than 100 years. It proves that they can be saved from extinction. In other words, it is possible to keep them from dying out. "This shows that recovery is actually" possible, says biologist Daniel Gammons. Most animals that get close to extinction don't recover. However, he said, "there's a real opportunity here to see success." It's taken more than 10 years of careful study to make it happen.
It has received many complaints about drones. Pilots have seen drones flying close to their planes. On Sept. 8, three different pilots reported "a very close call" with a drone as they flew into La Guardia Airport in New York. Even a small drone could bring down a jet. Safety is not the only problem. Another worry is that drones could be used to spy on people. Russell Percenti was arrested after he used a shotgun to shoot down a drone. His neighbor had been flying it over his house.
Even for those not attending college, the tests are important. They are used for entering job training programs. These programs can secure a good future for many poor students. Education officials say they are trying to stop cheating. In northern India, inspectors caught two students cheating. The inspectors were then attacked by home-made bombs. At a test center, inspectors caught school workers writing answers to an exam on a blackboard. The workers tried to toss the evidence out the window.
He also wants to train teachers so that technology can be used in the best way possible. The speech showed that Obama was serious about doing things his way. He gave his yearly State of the Union speech last week. In it the president said that Congress was fighting too much. Because they were fighting, fewer and fewer laws were being passed. Because of this, President Obama said his second term would be different. He would announce what he would do. Then he would take action without a vote wherever possible.
Scientists said the ruling will be good for patients. The cost of the gene test will probably go down. Myriad has been able to charge about $3,300 for its cancer test. The company said that most patients don't pay that amount. Myriad's lawyer said that the ruling will not harm the company in a major way. The company has many other patents and inventions. Lawyer Vernon Winters said that the court's decision has limits. Scientists can still try to get patents.
It might be hard to imagine why these kids would want to be in a writing class. One reason they take the class is that they miss out on  regular school. Writing classes help them learn, grow and discover themselves. Another reason is that being in juvenile hall can bring up strong feelings. For example, Budnick had one class read a newspaper article about a man named Steven Czifra. He spent years behind bars as a youth. Now, Czifra is a college student at the University of California in Berkeley. Budnick asked his students to write poems inspired by something Czifra said: "I have a gift."
The giant machine scanned the mummy, and the computer showed shapes in black-and-white. It picked up a round shape in the middle of his chest. It looked like a piece of jewelry called an amulet. In ancient Egypt, amulets were buried with mummies. The X-ray will copy the shape of that amulet. The doctors will take the picture to a 3-D printer and make a plastic copy. Soon, someone could hold a copy of that 3,000-year-old Egyptian amulet.
Jill puts the card number in her laptop. Now Sophie can take the book. Sophie will give the book back later. She can give it back to Jill today. Sophie can even take it to the library. Jill takes the book bike to other parks. Everyone is happy to see it coming. They like to see which books Jill brought.
SANTA ANA, Calif. " Wayne Irving's daughter was 15 when she asked to get her learner's permit. Irving was already unhappy about how much texting his daughter did. And he had just learned something very sad: The year before, more than 7,000 Americans had died from texting while driving. Irving decided he had to do something. In 2009 he began to work on a smartphone app to help solve the problem.
About 50 sixth-graders attended the camp. When they arrived, they took two tests to measure their ability to read social clues. In one, the kids looked at 48 photos of people making faces. They were asked to guess the feelings the faces had in each photo. In the second test, they watched a video with no sound and then guessed the actor's feelings. The kids took the tests again five days later. The researchers said the kids made an average of about 14 mistakes on the photo test at the beginning of camp. By the end of camp, they only made about nine mistakes.
Congress has failed to meet the deadline for approving spending bills 17 times since the 1970s. The shutdowns lasted from one day to three weeks. The last time was for a 21-day stretch in December 1995 and January 1996. Maya MacGuineas is president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. She said a shutdown would not be as bad as people think. But, she said, "the fact that this is how we govern is so shameful." The White House sent a message to federal agencies last week. It said to begin planning for a partial shutdown.
But these chemicals are toxic, or poisonous, to children's brains as they grow. Toxic stress can hurt the part of the brain that deals with feelings. The child may get into fights. He also may have trouble paying attention and calming down his body, said Daniel Taylor. The chemicals may also damage the part of the brain involved in memory, he said. These children may have trouble remembering things. It is harder for them to read and do well on tests. If toxic chemicals are released all the time, children can develop health problems, said Marcy Witherspoon.
His ancestors were converted to Christianity at the missions. He admits Native Americans were treated badly at the missions, but he does not blame Serra. He blames colonialism. During colonialism, Spain and other European countries came to North America. They used Native Americans to get what they wanted. Mistakes were made in the past, Galvan said. "The bottom line is: I believe Junipero Serra was a very good person in a very bad situation, which I call colonialism." There is still a question of how Serra will be remembered.
Chris Kemoeatu needed an operation to get a new kidney. He got the kidney from his brother. People have two kidneys, but only need one. Because of this, you can donate one of your kidneys and still be fine. What is unusual is that Kemoeatu played football for seven years for the Pittsburgh Steelers. His brother Ma'ake used to play for the Baltimore Ravens.
GLASGOW, Scotland " On Thursday, Scotland will vote on whether it should become an independent country. For more than 300 years, Scotland has been part of the United Kingdom. The U.K. also includes England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Scottish families are talking about how they will vote. Families are divided over the question. Most people older than 60 years old support staying in the United Kingdom. They worry about what will happen to their health care and the money they have saved.
Ride-sharing is becoming popular in cities. Using a phone, a person can ask for a car to pick them up. A driver knows where the person is through GPS. It uses satellites to pinpoint where someone is. If a driver is close by, they can pick up a passenger. They just pay for the ride, like a taxi. In the future, ride-sharing could be different. Instead of a human driver, a robot might make the pickup.
Mars may be more like Earth than people think. It turns out there is water on Mars. The car-sized robot runs on wheels. Its name is Curiosity. In 2011, the United States sent Curiosity to Mars to see if life there is possible. Curiosity traveled through space in a rocket.
But elected officials may not be able to boycott. New Jersey's law does not allow preferences when a town puts out a bid to get equipment or services, said Bill Dressel. For example, if a town wants to buy a fire truck, it puts out a bid. Companies respond by naming a price. "Local governments must follow state law," said Dressel. He is the executive director of the New Jersey association of cities. Dressel said state lawmakers could change the law. They did years ago in boycotting South Africa when it was under apartheid, a system of laws that separated whites from non-whites.
However, these animals cannot change on their own. They find ways to survive using genes. The genes are inherited from parents. They are like directions for the body. They can tell what color it will be, how strong it is, how big it is and more. Scientists have studied how animals and plants change to act or look like other plants or animals. Still, mysteries remain. Why can only female swallowtail butterflies look like other butterflies?
Today, coast redwoods exist only in a small area of California, up to the Oregon border. Giant sequoias live only in the Sierra Nevada mountains. There is more cause for concern. There is a lot more carbon dioxide in the air now than in the mid-1800s. Some scientists say if things keep going like this, redwoods will not be able to live in parts of California by 2100. That would be sad. It would be like losing a famous work of music, Dawson said.
Some leaders in Congress quickly said this plan would not work. White House officials disagreed. They said many more working people would benefit if Congress helped Obama raise the pay for everyone. The president also plans to pass a law to help workers save money. Not all companies offer plans to help workers save money for when they stop working. Some members of Congress have warned that if the president uses executive orders too much it could backfire. It could make Congress angry. Some members already don't trust Obama.
Its mission is to learn about what it is like on Mars. Scientists want to know if life ever existed there. Scientists also are curious if people could explore Mars safely. Curiosity has sent back important information about Mars. Curiosity has spotted water. The water was found in Mars' red dust. Scientists found something else. This dust seems to cover the whole planet.
So why don't the Amish have to be part of Obamacare? To understand that you need to go back nearly 60 years. It all started because they didn't want to pay Social Security taxes. Social Security taxes are collected by the government from the money people earn. In other words, the government takes some of your money now in order to take care of you later. Originally, only people who worked for businesses paid Social Security taxes. But during the 1950s, this changed: Farmers also began to be taxed. Many of the Amish refused to pay.
For a long time, biologists have studied how animals try to look like other animals. It teaches them a lot about natural selection. Natural selection is sometimes called "survival of the fittest." It means that animals that can change will survive. They can also change to eat different foods or become better at hunting. Animals that cannot change might get eaten or die out. However, these animals cannot change on their own. They find ways to survive using genes.
PITTSBURGH " The Copenhagen Zoo in Denmark decided recently to put down an 18-month-old giraffe. Workers at the Danish zoo said they had no choice but to kill the giraffe. They said its genes were too much like the genes of other giraffes. All plants and animals have genes. They play a big part in what animals and plants look and act like. Genes are passed down from parents.
It also will face Congo. The matches take place from early September to mid-November. Guinea is in a group with Ghana, Togo and Uganda. The qualifying matches will decide the 15 teams at the African Cup of Nations. It is holding the finals in January and February 2015.
Companies that make airplanes are changing the way they do things: They no longer build wings and jet bodies out of metal. Instead, they build them out of carbon-fiber composites. Just like cloth, it is woven together. One thing is hard to find, though: good tools to cut and shape the new material. Now, a Washington engineering firm called Electroimpact says it has built a better tool. It says its new machine can handle carbon-fiber composites better than anything else out there.
But one top official blamed the walkout on troublemakers "But things are getting back to normal," said Sushil Ghimire. The government said it would pay about $415 to the family of each Sherpa who died. But the Sherpas said they want more money and more help for the victims' families. It's not known how many of the 400 or so Sherpas on the mountain had left work. But many expedition companies have already canceled their climbs. Most attempts to reach Everest's peak are made in mid-May. The weather is better then.
Tremell is in El Sistema Minnesota. El Sistema is an after-school program. There are 18 children in the program. Some are in first grade. El Sistema teaches kids music. They learn how to play instruments like the violin and cello. The kids in El Sistema live in poor neighborhoods. When you are poor you don't have a lot of money.
He told them on the phone that they would receive the honor. He also called family members of recipients who had died. Morris, 72, was one of the nation's first Green Berets. The Berets are a small group of special forces. Obama said that when he called Morris, "his first reaction was, ‘Oh, my God, what have I done?' When I told him it was all good, the Medal of Honor, I could hear through the phone he almost passed out."
Horses should have to run the Preakness to be in the Belmont, he said. Bob Baffert trained Bayern. He said Chrome is a "cool customer." "He does everything right," Baffert said. She also said California Chrome has a chance to win the Triple Crown. Not having one since Affirmed proves just how hard it is. "I think, sooner or later, it'd be good if we had one," Rice said. "We're due."
GLEN ELLYN, Ill. " Daniela Polenchek grew up in Colombia. When she was 2 years old, she was hit by a car. She was hurt. She cannot walk. Daniela is now 15.
Bad milk starts to smell. No one wants to drink smelly milk. Customers do not know it is bad until they open it. Then they have to throw it away. Quinlan said that poor people should try to get fresh food. But sometimes the food is rotten. She said it is better to throw it away. Fresh fruits and vegetables go bad quickly.
LOS ANGELES " There is no National Football League (NFL) team in Los Angeles. Many teams say they might move to Los Angeles. It is a threat. They do this to get new places to play at home. They want their cities to give them new stadiums.
He added that the sign was written by experts. The goal of the label is to give buyers the right to know, he said. There are health risks to drinking sodas. They are a health problem "that will take more lives than gun violence," he said. It said that the companies already post calories on the front of many bottles. This is part of its "Clear on Calories" program. It began in 2010. Drink bottles also have lists of nutrition information.
The workers do not build the tracks at the theme park. Instead, they build them in their shop. That way they can bend the track better. Goliath's wheels will ride on a metal covering that is also filled with grout. It's important that the roller coaster is not too loud. Otherwise, people who live near Great America could get upset. There are about 35 men building the roller coaster. They are from Idaho, where it is cold.
Siso said it can drive a person crazy. It took three hours in line to buy toilet paper. She had to come back the next day to get corn flour. The lines are getting longer and people are getting angrier. People push and shove to take everything and leave nothing for the rest, she said. Many Venezuelans are angry with their president, Nicolas Maduro. The country's economy is weak. The government and people have less money, and not enough jobs pay well.
They can play in a giant "corn box." It's the same idea as a sandbox, only this one is filled with dried corn. The Cornival also offers pig races, pony and hay rides. Look out for the pumpkin chuckin' cannon. "It's all the stuff we used to do as kids," said Vierra, a lifelong farmer. "As a kid, you walked into the cornfield at night and a friend would jump out to try and scare you. You'd jump into a pile of straw or climb on top of haystacks. Who doesn't like that?
"It was incredible," says conservationist Simon Avery. "The birds are flying high over our heads, and they see water and come down." Things are looking bad for birds in California this year. The new man-made wetlands are one good thing. Wetlands have dried up. When birds crowd into smaller spaces, it is easy for diseases to spread. Canada and Alaska had a wet winter last year. More birds than usual were born.
When he met Muinos, he weighed nearly 250 pounds. Now, Sanchez has lost about 20 pounds. "I feel much better about myself," said Sanchez. "I have a lot more energy." He makes it like a dance party. He plays popular music. The kids play games. They work out with hula hoops, weights and balls.
And were they later pushed to move somewhere else? Or maybe they were wiped out? Marshall and her partners will do DNA tests. DNA holds the code for every cell in your body. DNA is also in plants and animals. Scientists hope DNA tests will clear things up. Until then, experts will wonder what cat is this? And where did it come from?
Rosa Parks never acted angry. She always seemed gentle and proper. Adrienne Cannon studies African-American history. She says Rosa Parks tried hard to seem gentle. However, Rosa Parks was more angry than she seemed. She wrote about her feelings. She wrote how badly she was treated. Blacks could not use the same bathrooms as whites.
It put in place a new "all-comers" rule. Now a student can join any group, no matter his or her background. The rule also says that anyone can be president of a group. For instance, a white student could lead the Chinese Student Association. They refused to go along with it. The university removed them from the list of official student groups. Unofficial groups can continue meeting. However, they do not get the same rights as official groups.
NOME, Alaska – Each year, teams of dogs and their drivers race across Alaska. They travel nearly 1,000 miles. The race is called the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. The mushers race to see who can make it to Nome first. Nome is a town in Alaska. Nome is getting ready for the race. It is a small town.
It was much younger than the scientists had thought it would be. That meant the soil wasn't as damaged as they had thought. The team then noticed a small cliff located near where Curiosity landed. The scientists saw that the cliff used to cover some rocks. But the cliff had worn away over time. This showed younger rock underneath. The team will send the rover to dig at the cliff. They hope to find some carbon.
Robert Millward, who started the initiative, said many young people are not interested in teaching. "They say that teachers don't make much" money, he said. "They see teaching as a woman's profession. They say, ‘I didn't have a good experience in school, so why would I want to spend life teaching?'" They hope to encourage young people to teach. At one workshop, 20 high school students sat in a room. The speaker asked them who planned to go to college. All raised their hands.
Maybe not now, but over time. Doctors say that the cuts would leave more families without enough food. That could worsen health for the poor. The result would be more visits to doctors' offices or hospitals. Hunger has many health risks. Among the worst is diabetes. And young children can have problems developing properly. Sometimes young brains don't get enough iron.
The dogs flew from Arizona. They went to an animal shelter in Idaho. Two years ago, Rork started Dog Is My CoPilot. It flies dogs from one state to another. They are sent to a place where there are too few. The idea is to find the animals new homes. Arizona has too many Chihuahuas. People can't adopt them all, said Melissa Gable.
"We think that California is dead wrong on this," the Governor of Iowa said. Iowa produces the most eggs in America. California's law says that hens must be able to turn around freely. They have to be able to lie down and stand up. The law prevents the sale of eggs from hens raised in "battery" cages. Battery cages are tiny. They give each hen only about 67 square inches of floor space. That's smaller than an 8x10 sheet of paper.
And if you are stuck in traffic, you can do something while your car drives you. Ride-sharing is becoming popular in cities. Using a phone, a person can ask for a car to pick them up. A driver knows where the person is through GPS. Nearly every cellphone has GPS now. If a driver is close by, they can pick up a passenger. They just pay for the ride, like a taxi. In the future, ride-sharing could be different.
Oil companies are not very happy. They are losing money. Experts are confused. They are trying to understand changes in the economy. Economists are not sure if oil's drop in price is good or bad. A barrel of oil now costs $58. Last summer it was $107. So what's going on?
"It's basically like you're Xeroxing it," Wheeler said. Once they've got enough of it, they can tell what it is. They copy the DNA through something called polymerase chain reaction (PCR). It was first discovered in 1983. PCR takes several steps. First, a special enzyme is added to a DNA sample. Then the DNA is heated up to 202 degrees. DNA has two strands, or sections.
A jail filled with teens accused of crimes is not where you would expect to find him. Budnick is also a volunteer teacher. For years, he has been teaching writing classes in juvenile halls. When children and teenagers break the law, they sometimes have to spend time behind bars. Many are waiting for their court trials. Some spend years there. They may even go on to adult prison. Juvenile hall can be a difficult place in which to grow up.
WASHINGTON " Doctors have a warning for Congress: Don't cut food stamps. If it does, the U.S. government could get hit with bigger health bills. Maybe not now, but over time. That could worsen health for the poor. The result would be more visits to doctors' offices or hospitals. And those visits would have to be paid for by the government. Hunger has many health risks.
Investigators found the plane had lost power. Ice had built up during the flight. The ice stopped fuel from flowing into the engines. Robert Herbst is a retired American Airlines 767 pilot. The images make him think the Asiana Airlines plane may have had the same engine problem. "This is very obvious what happened," Herbst said. "They landed short of the runway. They were too low for the flight path and the tail of the aircraft hit the sea wall."
The United States wants to build a new top-secret warplane. The bombers could cost billions of dollars. Two teams of airplane makers are competing to make them. Experts do not agree over whether the United States needs a new bomber or not. Some say the new warplane is necessary to protect the country. Others call it a big waste of money. It could wind up being one of the most expensive planes the government ever built.
But the air does not come back out the same way. The air moves in a circle. This is much better way to get oxygen from the air than the way humans breathe. Scientists discovered that birds breathed like this in the first half of the 20th century. So the air in train stations was very dirty. Researchers looked at pigeons that had been breathing this smoky air. They found that the birds had just one black area in their lungs. If pigeons breathed like humans do, scientists would have expected to find that the whole lung was black.
CHICAGO " On Tuesday, the government hosted a meeting for an unusual reason. They were there to settle a question: Can college athletes form a union? If the idea is approved, the new union will be the first of its kind in U.S. history. Together, they bargain for things like better pay or work hours. Until now, no one has thought of student athletes as workers. These are questions not too many people have thought to ask before: Are students who play sports for their school actually working? If so, should they have the same rights as other workers?
"You're dealing with one of the most endangered species in the United States," she said. A disaster like a fire or hurricane could nearly wipe them all out, she added. One huge problem for the Florida panthers is space. Their living area is shrinking. As their space shrinks, the panthers face more dangers. Last year 15 were killed by cars and trucks. Three were killed by other panthers. That is why Florida wildlife workers are trying so hard to rescue the orphans.
Some people bake it in chocolate chip cookies. Denny's even has a maple bacon milkshake. Yes, Please! DeWayne Dove is a vice president with SpenDifference. Dove says bacon is also costing restaurants more. Most restaurants plan to raise prices. They are also giving customers less bacon. Still, plenty of bacon lovers are willing to pay.
Girls in India do not do this. "But after two or three months, I started to speak English," she said. Noushin got used to life in America. Bruno Borges is in the class. When Bruno was 7, his family moved to Sweden, a country in Europe. Later they came to United States. "You need to be Always do your best.
Arne Duncan is the top education official in the U.S. government. He says that the United States "has a great distance to go." Much has to be fixed before schools can provide "opportunities for every student to succeed." Nationally, about 1 million children were in public preschool programs in the 2011-2012 school year. Nearly 5,000 preschoolers were suspended once that year, says the study. At least 2,500 were suspended more than once. Hispanic children made up nearly one-third of all preschoolers. They accounted for one-quarter of the preschoolers suspended once.
The cloths are pieces of fabric that were used to wrap mummies. The scientists were looking for clues that might show when the ancient Egyptians started to make mummies . They used microscopes to look at the small pieces of fabric. Bits of bone and skin were stuck to the cloth. There were small amounts of different chemicals on the cloths. They were from plants, animals and natural petroleum. The chemicals are not usually found on cloth as old as the cloth the scientists looked at. They believe the chemicals were spread on the cloth before a mummy was wrapped.
EDWARDSVILLE, Ill. " Teachers in an Illinois school district are being told to stop talking about the protests in Ferguson with their students. Ferguson is a city in Missouri. On Aug. 9, a white police officer there shot and killed an unarmed black teen named Michael Brown. Since then, people have been protesting. Many people are talking about the 18-year-old's death. Meanwhile, in the Edwardsville School District, only a few miles from Ferguson, Missouri, teachers have been told to "change the subject and refocus the students." This new rule has upset some parents. They think the teachers should talk about the events in Ferguson.
He then handed her a stack of coded messages. One day she was examining a message sent on the Italian navy's Enigma. She noticed there was not one L in it. Enigma never encoded a letter as itself. Batey suspected that she was looking at a test message a lazy operator had made by repeatedly pressing the L key. With this discovery, "Mavis broke the main Italian naval Enigma," Smith told the Los Angeles Times last week. She did this based on one message. In March 1941 she decoded a far more important message.
That is the problem. Congress passes laws that cost money. The president has to make sure the money gets paid. Those two goals don't always match. He wrote a history about the debt limit. The Constitution set up the fights between Congress and the president as part of a system called checks and balances. The whole purpose of that system was to stop one branch of the government, say Congress, from ruling like a king. The legal limit on just how much debt the federal government can borrow didn't start until 100 years ago.
Almost all of the eggs in the U.S. are produced in battery cages. Western European countries have already banned battery cages. People "are demanding higher animal welfare," said Joe Maxwell. Animal welfare is how an animal is treated. He helps run the Humane Society of the United States. On the other side of the fight is Blake Hurst. He is also a farmer. He's also the boss of the Missouri Farm Bureau.
It will help "protect the planet from asteroids." said Jason Crusan, who runs a lab in the agency. This year, NASA's scientists hope to receive help from citizen scientists. They want to be able to find and track asteroids. Then they need to know whether they are dangerous to life on Earth. Finally, NASA will come up with ways to prevent them from hitting and wiping out plants, animals and humans. "This is a big global problem that needs everybody to solve," NASA spokeswoman Sarah Ramsey said. "We can't do it alone.
Dajani said he used to be angry at all Israelis. Then his father became sick. He was cared for in an Israeli hospital. Dajani said that the treatment of his father and other Arab patients at the Israeli hospital changed his feelings toward Israelis. "I'm doing it because it's the right thing to do," he said. "I would do it again."
WASHINGTON " There could be no chocolate without cocoa. And without companies like Cargill Inc., Americans would not be able to get this important ingredient. Cargill is a huge trader and producer of foods like grain, meat and cocoa. Cocoa makes most kids happy, at least when they eat it as chocolate. But cocoa has a dark side too. Much of the cocoa crop is grown on farms where children work. The work is dangerous and keeps the children from a bright future.
It can mess with groups that don't agree with our government. In 2011, the Boston police, Boston Regional Intelligence Center and the FBI were busy tracking people. But they were just members of protest groups, not terrorists. As a result, they seem to have ignored important intelligence. This tells you a lot about what's important to our crooked spy state. In the 1960s, Martin Luther King Jr. was inspiring millions in his fight for the rights of African-Americans and poor people. At the same time, the FBI was busy spying on his phone and harassing him. Today, it would have information on his every move and phone call.
That's in a suburb of Chicago. Some barges traveling through it carry materials that could catch on fire. And sparks could fly between barges. Some people don't like the electric fence. They say it's necessary to stop the Asian carp. Josh Mogerman works for the Natural Resources Defense Council. It's a group that tries to protect nature. He said the problems with the electric fence are serious.
She has been kept at Miami's Seaquarium ever since. On Wednesday, the government said that Lolita is still a Puget Sound orca. Orcas are also known as killer whales. They are in the dolphin family and are very large. Females can be as long as 26 feet. There are now fewer than 80 wild Puget Sound orcas left. They are protected by the government. Lolita will now have special protection too.
Missouri farmers sell one-third of their eggs to California. Now they must decide what to do. They might have to spend more than $120 million on new henhouses to follow California's law. But the other choice is to stop selling to California. People in California buy more eggs than any other state. Some other states are following California's example. Michigan, Oregon and Washington have passed laws demanding more space for hens. Ohio has also banned new battery cages.
"Now I actually like vegetables," the president said. "Because they're prepared right." The event was part of Michelle Obama's Let's Move program. The program fights childhood [obesity](. in America. It can hurt a person's health in many ways. About 140 people attended the event. The winning recipes included  "Wisconsin Solar Oven-Simmered Chili" and "Kickin' Colorful Bell Peppers Stuffed With Quinoa." Quinoa is a grain-like food high in protein.
It plans to say if poison gas was used. But it won't say which sides used it. Sweden's leader Fredrik Reinfeldt said his country wants the U.N. involved. It also wants to solve the civil war through talks or elections. "This small country will always say ‘Let's put our hope into the United Nations, let us push on some more to get a better situation,' " Reinfeldt said. He was at the same news conference as Obama. Needs U.N. Approval Obama says there is no doubt that poison gas was used by Assad's government.
When she was 11, she snuck into the United States. She knew that at anytime she could be sent back to Honduras. Now, she doesn't have to look over her shoulder all the time. The government is letting some people who came here illegally before age 16 stay, at least for the time being. But she can't be sent back to Honduras anytime soon. "It definitely feels different," said Navarro. She is now 23 and lives in North Philadelphia. "Now, we don't have to watch our backs.
LOS ANGELES " California and New York still attract hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world. But the U.S. Census Bureau says that Americans find Texas, Florida, Colorado and the Carolinas far more appealing. The Census Bureau counts the number of people who live in the United States. Its latest report found that states in the Southern and Western U.S. helped the country's population grow the most. More babies were born in those states than in the North and East. But, the other reason was more foreigners and newcomers from other states moved to Southern and Western states. The study tracked these moves.
He jumps clear over a bench and keeps running. He comes to a wall. He jumps at it, grabbing the top with his hands. In a second, he is up and over the wall, running again. He is doing parkour, a sport that is becoming more popular around the world. People who do parkour are called "traceurs." Traceurs run and jump through the city. They bounce off walls, jump over fences, hop off roofs.
What's going on inside a hurricane's eye should now be much clearer. Coyotes also will be flown into a hurricane's eye wall. The eye is the calmest part of the storm. But, the eye wall is the most dangerous part. It is the area with the heaviest rain and strongest winds. The goal will be to find the speed of the strongest winds. That information should help the National Hurricane Center improve its predictions. It will help show just how strong a hurricane will become.
Then, Rice knocked Palmer off her feet. As she fell, her head hit a handrail in the elevator. The fall knocked her out. Before the video came out, a different video showed Rice pulling her out of the elevator. When the first video was shown, the NFL said Rice would not be allowed to play for two games. Many people thought the punishment was too light. They thought Rice should be fired. Roger Goodell, who leads the NFL, was in charge of punishing Rice.
They were making it harder to leave or go into the city. A Ukrainian army official said they will keep stopping the pro-Russia supporters from sneaking out of Slovyansk. Soldiers are also stopping them from getting help or more weapons. "We are dealing not with an army," the officer said. I understand that people are uncomfortable, he said. They will thank us "when we are done with these thugs and criminals."
The whooping crane is the tallest bird in North America. It is also one the rarest. There are only about 600 birds left. Wildlife workers have been trying to keep them alive. They want them to have chicks. The shootings have hurt their plans. The three cranes died.
Since 2008, bacon prices have gone up three times faster than other items. It is going up faster than other meats. The price increase has several causes. California is in a drought. The food to feed the pigs costs more. Also, a new disease has killed about 7 million piglets since 2013, said John Green. He works for the National Pork Board. Mainly, Americans are hungry for bacon, Green said.
Lawmakers who pushed for the new rule say it will strengthen families. They say it will make sure that shopping will not "shorten the time that families spend together." One government official does not like the law. He is Economy Minister Mihaly Varga. Instead of the law, Varga said stores should pay more to people who work Sundays.
Diplodocus had smaller, narrower teeth. It grew new teeth about once a month. D'Emic had questions. How could two giant plant-eating dinosaurs live together in the same place? D'Emic thinks Diplodocus grazed on plants close to the ground. That meant Camarasaurus had plenty of food up high. There was enough for everyone. There's something else.
They felt she was sympathetic to their views. "It was like a shot to the heart when she said, ‘I'm going to make you proud,''' said Robyn Chaney of Dillingham. "It gives you a glimmer of hope." Pebble Partnership is the name of the company that wants to build the mine. The EPA may use the Clean Water Act to block the company before it applies for permission. The Act protects against water pollution. The area of the mine is full of lakes and streams. The sweeping land is surrounded by mountains.
The push for reparations has been gaining steam in recent weeks. Leaders of the 15-member Caribbean Community group agreed to ask the former colonial powers to pay up. They have met with a British law firm and called for apologies. They might even go to the International Court of Justice if the Europeans will not deal with them. The leaders say what they want most is money for programs to help lift people out of poverty. The money could be used for things like building schools and making bridges and roads. Ralph Gonsalves is prime minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines. He is one of the leaders.
Understanding how a new flu virus moves is very important. They say that more tests should be done. Winter flus are the H1, H2 or H3 types. A flu shot can protect you against them. Each person infected with an animal virus is seen as "a threat to public health," Koopmans said. In the past 100 years, all the big flu outbreaks have come from animals. The big question now is if this flu could spread to more people.
About one in three rated them "D." About another one in three gave them an "F." Lee Miringoff says people don't believe their leaders can make things better. He is the head of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion in New York. More than half the people said they don't like the job Obama is doing. Some people are Democrats and other people are Republicans. President Obama is a Democrat. It's not surprising that three of every four other Democrats thought he's doing a good job. But nine of 10 Republicans did not like what he's doing as president.
But the new limits mean the United States may not use drones to kill anyone it wants. Before, anyone who was thought to be a major threat could be a killed by a drone. Now, a drone strike will only be allowed against fighters planning a terror attack. Obama made the announcement in a speech about America's battle with al-Qaida. If innocent people could get killed, drone strikes will not be allowed, a White House official said. On Wednesday, the White House said that drone strikes have killed four U.S. citizens. One of the victims was the 16-year-old son of a terrorist suspect. Just because something is legal, Obama said, doesn't mean "it is wise or moral" in every case,
He and a grade school buddy bought two convenience stores in Ohio, where he is from. Hartline has been known to help out there when football season is over. He waits on customers. He unpacks boxes and puts products on shelves. "I only invest if I really understand," he said. Many pro athletes make millions of dollars. Many of them also run out of money. The National Football League and teams such as the Dolphins are teaching players about handling money.
Gross is an American who has been in a Cuban jail for five years. Cuba said he brought cellphones and computers into Cuba, which is against the law. Gross, who is 65 years old, has already been sent home. Cuba and the United States spoke secretly for a year about freeing him. He is weak and can barely walk. In Cuba, he had refused medical care, food and visits from American officials. He was protesting being kept in jail. The United States made a deal with Cuba.
. Apple revealed the new iPhones at its headquarters in California. The phones will go on sale on Sept. 20. Why sell a cheaper phone? There are more Chinese customers than anywhere else. But people there do not have as much money. The 5C costs less. It may help Apple sell more phones to the Chinese.
It wasn't a regular war. Instead, it was a standoff. On one side were U.S.-led Western countries; on the other side were the Soviet Bloc countries led by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union, in turn, was controlled by Russia. Russia then lost control of many of the Soviet republics. Among these were Ukraine and the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Several times during the Cold War, Soviet submarines entered Swedish waters. The most serious event occurred in 1981.
The manager of Iran's team is Carlos Queiroz from Portugal. But when he trains the players, he speaks English. Queiroz also knows Beitashour well. When he started to train the team in Iran three years ago, he went looking for players with Iranian backgrounds all over the world. Not all the players back in Iran were happy to have people born in other countries also playing with them. But that changed after they got to know each other and play in games together. Omid Namazi once worked with the Iranian team. He says that people did not get along very well at the beginning.
Instead of using silverware, the guests were allowed to eat with their fingers. The kids won a healthy recipe contest called the Healthy Lunchtime Challenge. More than 1,300 children between the ages of 8 and 12 entered. The 54 winners were invited to dinner at the White House. Winners also came from three U.S. territories and Washington, D.C. President Barack Obama was not invited to the event. But that did not stop him from making a surprise visit. Once he was in the East Room, he joked that he usually gets invited to events in his own house.
The English language has a lot of strange spelling rules. Take the letter grouping "ough," for example. It can be said different ways. Or how about "oh" as in "dough?" Sometimes it is "off" as in "cough." A group of experts in Great Britain and the United States want to make changes. They say there should be a meeting called an International English Spelling Congress.
But nothing is as unbelievable as what happened on Sunday. The California teenager survived a 5½-hour, nonstop flight to Maui, Hawaii. "Somebody can come onto an airport and get to the wheel well of an airplane," Brian Jenkins said. If this is true, it means that "someone else can plant a bomb." Some of the research the group does is on national safety. San Jose's airport is surrounded by 6-foot fences. Some areas have barbed wire on top. Some of the area where the plane takes off is monitored by cameras.
These viewers turn as the action moves around them. The theater has eight projectors and seven speakers placed above the viewers. There are also speakers underneath the platform. The screens are 11 feet high. This was chosen because "seeing the elephant" was a common expression during the Civil War. It was used by soldiers to describe their first experience of battle.
Juices aren't the best way to fix that problem, said Christina Stark. She'a a nutritionist. But she said juices are better than nothing. If you're going to drink juice, try vegetable blends, Bethany Doerfler said. Her advice: add just a little fruit to make them tastier.
Johanson is now the head of the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University. He spoke about how Lucy's discovery changed what scientists thought about early humans. He also discussed what he hopes to find next. _Newsela has adapted the answers given by Johanson. I first began studying early humans at the beginning of the 1970s. At the time, most people thought humans came from Africa, but they became modern humans in Europe. She completely changed the idea of where we became human. Lucy showed us that human beings began in the area of Ethiopia where she was found.
Scientists who were not involved in the study praised the find. "This is a historic discovery," scientist Geoffrey Marcy said. Scientists are hoping to find plenty of other planets like Kepler-186f. Telescopes in space are searching for signs of water on the planet. The planet is not just Earth-size, it is truly Earth-like. Kepler has so far spotted 1,800 planets. However, fewer than 24 are in an area far enough from a star that living things could exist there. The other planets are either too hot or too cold.
He got the call from his staff at about 10:30 p.m. They told him the 15-year-old buildings full of guests were sinking into the ground. Sinkholes are common in land where the rock below the surface can be dissolved by water flowing through it, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The science groups says that type of land is found in about one-fifth of the country. A guest ran into the street to alert resort workers after the windows began to shatter, Caldwell said. Firefighters arriving on scene immediately went door-to-door of building 104 to help guests escape. The three-story building was sliced nearly in half. About 20 people left behind everything they brought to their vacation home.
One out of 100 is a low rate of child death. Seventeen out of 100 is a high one. Around the world, the rate of young children dying has been cut in half since 1990. The United Nations was hoping for more progress by 2015. Even the poorest countries are making progress, said Dr. Mickey Chopra of the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF). Every region has improved since 1990. The challenge now is to find out what works and use it all over. The region with the most serious problem is sub-Saharan Africa.
All five of them are under the age of 1. Health officials are trying to figure out how the babies caught the disease. The babies all go to KinderCare Learning Center in Palatine, Illinois. Measles can cause severe health problems. About a week ago, Illinois discovered a case of the measles. An adult had the disease. It was the first case of measles this year. Health officials said it was an adult who lives near Chicago.
"The NFL will spend $25 million on making youth sports safer. It will increase the number of athletic trainers in schools. It will also educate parents about sports safety. "And $5 million will be spent on improving helmets. Scientists hope they will provide better protection against concussion.
The whole purpose of that system was to stop one branch of the government, say Congress, from ruling like a king. The legal limit on just how much debt the federal government can borrow didn't start until 100 years ago. That is when Congress let the Treasury sell Liberty Bonds. Before then, Congress had sometimes allowed the Treasury Department sell bonds to raise money for special projects. The government also pays them extra money, called interest. The Liberty Bonds changed things. Congress approved them so that the government could pay less to borrow as it entered World War I. In 1919, the debt ceiling was about $43 billion.
They decided to sue. Their case went all the way to the Supreme Court. The court decided that just because Myriad found the genes does not mean it could control them. The judges said the company should not have been given the patents. Billions of dollars were at stake. Having the patents helped Myriad earn a lot of money. Myriad could charge more to screen for the genes since no other company could offer the same test. Lawyer Sandra S. Park represented the scientists who sued.
WASHINGTON " A state dinner at the White House is a fancy affair. But on Tuesday night, the White House hosted one just for kids. The young guests walked into the White House as a harp played. They moved into the largest room in the White House called the East Room. Tables filled the room so guests could be seated for an eight-course meal.
Most of the money went to Stephen C. Foster Elementary School. The library and playground were fixed up and improved. Murals were painted on the walls. The bathrooms were fixed. Before WME started helping, Foster had serious problems. The bathrooms were in bad shape. Some kids were holding it because they didn't want to use the bathroom. But the program is really about one-on-one mentoring.
Franklin, one of our Founding Fathers, may have been right about turkeys being better than eagles. The case can be made, with some humor. The turkey is a "much more respectable bird," Franklin wrote. He meant wild turkeys. The bald eagle is a slob. It fools America by looking like a powerful bird, ready for action. OK, those were not Franklin's exact words. But that was the idea.
The song tells the story of a giant flag. The flag was flying over a fort in Baltimore. Americans were fighting with England. It was the War of 1812. Key was in a ship. He saw the huge flag far away. The day was rising and he thought the moment was beautiful. He described the flag as "The Star-Spangled Banner" which became the name of the song.
A mummy is a body wrapped in cloth and buried in the ground. If you look a little closer, you will discover something interesting. Buckley and Jones are scientists and archaeologists. Archaeologists study the humans of the past. Jones studies ancient fabrics and Buckley studies ancient chemicals. They came together to study mummies.
For it to work, people need to be rich also. Rich people have the free time and money to visit the wilderness. Muir wanted Californians to appreciate their mountains. He thought they would backpack, ski or rock climb through the Sierra Mountains. Some people say Californians really need more city parks. And they need more roads and trails in wild lands. Nature exists in many forms, they say. Untouched wilderness is only one.
The 5-year-old had a man-made one. It is called a prosthetic. He thought it was pretty useless and a bit scary. Now, he has a new hand. It is easy for him to use. Griffin's hand was made with a 3-D printer. A 3-D printer melts sheets of plastic into three-dimensional objects. It can make any shape.
Students who break rules will now receive help from a counselor. In the past, they were often arrested and sent to court. School officials hope the new system can keep students away from police and courts. Many schools started using a "zero tolerance" policy during 1970s and 1980s. Zero tolerance punishments were popular for many years. But the system had problems. It was unfair, with blacks and Latinos more likely to be punished than whites, activists say. There were 9,000 arrests and tickets in the 2011-2012 school year.
Yet, water samples have been taken near the fence. And they've been taken in the canal on the Lake Michigan side of the fence. They show something different. The samples have regularly shown Asian carp DNA during the past four years. The new study may lead to changes in the use of barges. It might also affect how the fence operates. Safety is also a big concern. The electrified section of canal is about 30 miles downstream from Lake Michigan.
The size of the spying program isn't known. Yet, the reports suggest that the spy agencies can easily collect information from apps. Two of the biggest apps mentioned in reports are "Angry Birds" and Google Maps. The NSA says that it watches phones for good reason. The NSA says it is not interested in "everyday Americans." The agency says it only collects information "that we are authorized by law to collect." GCHQ said its activity was legal and "necessary." It's no surprise that spy groups are interested in tracking cellphones.
John Kerry is the U.S. Secretary of State. His job is to manage the U.S.'s relationships with other countries. Kerry spoke about the Crimea situation on Sunday. He said the U.S. may not go to the G-8 summit. This year it is to be held in June in Sochi, Russia. Kerry also talked of possible ways that Russia could be punished. The Ukrainian government said there was no reason for Russia to invade Ukraine. It warned of a "disaster."
Jerry says treating dogs like old tools is wrong. "These dogs, they were like people," he said. The handlers decided to make a change. They wanted to bring the Army dogs home. In 1992, Congress made a new rule. Now the Army brings all of its dogs home. The dogs are treated like true soldiers.
They were angry with her because she was trying to help girls go to school in Pakistan. Yousafzai was just 15 and on her way home from school at the time. Two other girls were also injured in the attack. Yousafzai has since become famous around the world. Since being shot, she has called for getting more girls educated in very religious areas of Pakistan. Her views upset Islamic extremists. They believe that girls should not go to school. They think they should stay in the home.
The wins were 25 years apart. California Chrome's owners and trainer hope their horse will break that streak. Spectacular Bid won the series' first two races in 1979. He lost at Belmont. California Chrome jockey Victor Espinoza has been in the running for the Triple Crown before. He rode War Emblem to victory in the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness in 2002. He said he'll likely enjoy himself more this time around. Thoroughbred racing is a big business.
It also spreads over two continents. One half of Istanbul lies in Europe, while the other half sits in Asia. The city is connected by bridges across one of the busiest waterways on the planet, the Bosporus Strait. Istanbul is an important city for trade. Turkey is larger than the state of Texas. Istanbul is a very modern city, but other parts of Turkey are less developed. Around 99 percent of Turks have a Muslim background. However, religion and politics are supposed to remain separate, just as they are in the U.S.
Like a rodeo, it's hard on man and on the bull. In this part of South America, people grow up with coleo. Farm workers who have to chase down runaway cattle learn it on the job. This part of Colombia is the worldwide center of the sport. They come here from around Latin America and beyond. At one event, there were Venezuelans in colorful shirts. There were Mexicans with their big sombreros. And then there were the men from South Florida.
Like many stars, though, not everyone loves her. Some say Hello Kitty has no ideas of her own. She can never talk back. After all, she has no mouth. Inside the museum exhibit, a DJ wears Hello Kitty headphones. Longtime Hello Kitty fan Gianfranco Ocampo is there. The 23-year-old art student said he collected Hello Kitty dolls as a kid. He also has attended Hello Kitty tea parties.
NEW YORK " The new World Trade Center Tower is America's tallest building. The building is in New York. It beat out a building in Chicago called the Willis Tower. The decision was not simple. The experts had to decide what to measure.
A study published this week helps show that link. Many poor families run out of money for food at the end of the month. And more poor people with diabetes are hospitalized then, too. Trips to the hospital go up compared to the first week of the month. Most states send out food stamps at the beginning of the month. So, people often run out of food by the end of the month. Dr. Hilary Seligman headed up the study. She said money spent on treating people who don't have enough food is high.
And that job is very important. The Center is the government agency that forecasts hurricanes and tropical storms. Better forecasts can help keep more people safe when extreme weather strikes. Now the NHC is running an improved computer program to help make those forecasts more accurate. It can make up to 213 trillion calculations per second. The faster supercomputer and improved program should allow the Center to better figure out how the storms are constructed. Forecasters need that information. It helps show where a storm is headed and how strong it might get.
But, videos of his music are on YouTube. "Nobody thought of the border wall as possibly anything other than something to separate people," he said. He hopes his music will get people on both sides of the border to talk more. He thinks people fear the fence. Some people try to enter even if they aren't allowed to. Often, they are looking for better jobs. After the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks the fence was built up even more. Now it's made of solid steel in some places.
In Norway, people are said to be born with skis on their feet. It was only the second time Norway hasn't won a single one of the relay medals since 1964. But the news got even worse. Its biggest rival Sweden won both races. "To be beaten by the Swedes is the worst that can happen," Petter Northug said. He is the Norwegian anchor, or team captain. The loss has been all over the news in Norway. There are rumors that the team's coaches could lose their jobs after the Sochi Games.
It will mean less pollution. One new company called Hampton Creek sells mayonnaise and cookies that use plant products instead of eggs. Many farmers like the technology. The farmers are running their fields using iPads. Farmers want more technology to help them grow more food, and to save money. Ryan Jacobsen is a farmer. He is also in charge of the Fresno County Farm Bureau in California. "It's an exciting time to be a farmer right now," he said.
The rover can drive around the planet like a car. Last Monday, scientists said the rover had made a discovery. It had found the remains of an ancient lake. It was in a hole on the surface of the planet. This lake had just the right chemicals for life to thrive. It existed at around the same time that life was just starting on Earth. The rover found that the crater was once full of water. Some simple animals may have lived there.
They say coins last longer, and it would save the government money. But, the Federal Reserve says, "Don't bet on it." The Federal Reserve is the bank of the U.S. government. It's nicknamed "the Fed." The Fed studied the cost of switching from paper money to coins. It tried to figure out if it was worth it. It found that the dollar bill should still be used. It shouldn't be switched for a dollar coin.
The three risk damaging their livers and other organs as the fast goes on. Medina isn't surprised that some Republicans say the fast is a stunt to get attention. Others say Medina's fast is raising public awareness like labor leader Cesar Chavez once did. Chavez organized farm workers in the 1960s and 1970s. Medina wants the White House to do more. Congress would have to vote to change the immigration system. But, Medina says Obama could make sure people are not kicked out of the country so quickly. And it could keep more families together, says Medina.
It hopes to become the most important encyclopedia again. An encyclopedia has information about many different things. It includes articles on topics like animals, science, countries and famous people. Salesmen used to go to houses and knock on doors selling Encyclopaedia Britannica. It cost a lot of money, but many people were willing to buy them. They thought Britannica was the best encyclopedia. More than two years ago, the company stopped publishing the books. It put the whole encyclopedia on the Internet.
"They are growing vigorously." But the growth comes while other very bad things are happening to the planet, she said. Scientists continue to be worried about water. One study showed there is less fog in redwood areas along California's coast. But so far the lack of fog may have been a good thing. It may have allowed more sunlight to reach the trees, said scientist Todd Dawson. Giant sequoias live in the Sierra Nevada mountains. They are cousins of the redwoods.
It compared raising cows to raising other meats such as pigs or chickens. The scientists found that cows needed 28 times more land than the other animals. They also needed 11 times more water. Cows also didn't just take land and water. Greenhouse gases can have an effect on the Earth's temperature. They add to global warming and can hurt the environment. The study said cows gave off five times more greenhouse gases than other farm animals. For people, the clear answer is to replace beef with something else, said Gidon Eshel.
First lady Laura Bush played a big part in planning President George W. Bush's library. Before becoming first lady, she was a librarian. She had a lot of ideas for her husband's library. She helped choose where it would be built and how it should look. In fact, the first presidential library was set up by first lady Sarah Polk. In 1849, President James Polk left office. He was sick and he died soon after. Sarah Polk then collected his papers, paintings and belongings.
Now SeaWorld San Diego says that will change. They will try to make the orcas' lives better. They will make a bigger pool for the orcas. The new pool will be very big. Visitors will also see the orcas underwater. Jim Atchison is SeaWorld's president. He said the new pool will be very different. It will change "how visitors experience killer whales," he said.
Public educators have been targeted. Our government has the ability to use the NSA's information for the wrong purposes. It can mess with groups that don't agree with our government. In 2011, the Boston police, Boston Regional Intelligence Center and the FBI were busy tracking people. As a result, they seem to have ignored important intelligence. Information was literally handed to them about the terrorists who bombed the Boston Marathon. This tells you a lot about what's important to our crooked spy state. In the 1960s, Martin Luther King Jr. was inspiring millions in his fight for the rights of African-Americans and poor people.
YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. " Republican and Democrats are battling in Washington. They just got married. The highlight of their honeymoon was supposed to be a visit to Yosemite National Park. But the park was closed. In fact, all the National Parks are shut.
The suicide rate among native youth is 2-1/2 times that of any other group of young people in the U.S. "It is definitely a national problem, a national emergency," Bailey said. Patricia Whitefoot directs Indian Education for the Toppenish School District. She said her students' parents call suicide prevention is a top priority. Native students took a "wellness walk" last Friday. It's just one step in what will have to be a longer journey, Whitefoot said. "Teachers are so busy paying attention to test scores, how much time is there for addressing these major health issues in our community? And, as teachers, that has not been their training." Vanessa Smartlowit is in the Yakama Nation's health department.
Noori lives in Kabul, but his wife and daughter live in Toronto, Canada. While in Toronto, Noori learned how popular food trucks are. Now, he has brought them to Afghanistan. In May, Noori and his cousin, Abdullah Karim, started their new company. The new business sells hot dogs, burgers and chicken sandwiches. Food is sold from the back of five small trucks. Inside each truck there are hot plates and deep-fryers. On a cool fall morning, Noori visited one of his trucks.
They hope that these patterns are the same for everyone. The patterns are not always the same, though. This study only tested 42 people. Maybe those 42 people were different in some way. Also, all of the players in the study were professional football players. They had all played in the NFL. The NFL is where the best football players play against each other. Most people who play football as kids do not end up playing in the NFL.
Since then, it has backed pro-Russia fighters in eastern Ukraine. Russia says its actions in Ukraine were necessary. It claims it had to act to protect Ukrainians with a Russian background. Russian-speaking Ukrainians, it said, were being mistreated. They feel it was just an excuse for a land grab. Recently, a top Russian official made the same claims about the Baltic states. He said people of Russian background are being mistreated in those countries too. The Baltic states have been alarmed by such talk.
But departments also receive less ordinary items. A spokesman for the Defense Department said it gives out rifles, helicopters and trucks that can drive over explosives. This year, the government is taking a hard look at continuing the equipment giveaway program. Normally, it would continue with no problems. Carl Levin is the Michigan Democrat who leads the Senate Armed Services Committee. On Friday, he said the program needed to be checked out. Congress needs to decide if the equipment the police departments receive is being used the right way, he said. Local police departments need extra money.
He was elected Pope in March. Francis was the first pope from Latin America. He was also the first Jesuit to be elected pope. Jesuits are a group of priests in the Catholic Church. The pope wants people to worry about the poor. He says the church should worry less about social issues such as gay marriage. When he became pope, he chose the name Francis in honor of Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of the poor. He has spoken against the world's worshipping of money.
It was a natural choice. Strong family ties and trade exist between the two neighbors. But the numbers have dropped with the spike in drug violence. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto says there is less violence. Areas bordering Texas have been plagued with killings. States surrounding Mexico City are other hot spots. Justin Bogda, 21, took a summer job at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City in 2013. He was studying at the University of Southern California at the time.
So the scientists tested 30 more people. Those who said they took the least pleasure in music also showed the least emotion, or feelings, when listening. These people showed little emotion even when they listened to pieces they had chosen themselves. Emotion was measured by looking at changes in heart rate. "They were not just saying so," said the study's leader, Josep Marco Pallares. The way their bodies reacted matched what they were saying. In fact, their bodies didn't react to the music. It was already known that there are people who can't understand music well.
They cost $10 to $65 more than the lowest-priced tickets. Spirit's Big Front Seat has 6 extra inches of legroom. It costs an extra $12 to $199 more. Things are likely to get worse, said Jan Brueckner. Brueckner said he gets upset when somebody leans the seat in front of him all the way back. "But I think people need to be more considerate in these tight cabins," he said. Seth Kaplan works for Airline Weekly. He predicts that passengers will continue to fly on airlines with tight seats.
Right now, it is being delayed to allow for more time to study it. The law's creator is named Richard Bloom. He said that making a real change is difficult. It will take time to convince the government to act. Whales, he said, should not be in aquariums.
It's a first for The Dali, an entire museum devoted to the surrealist artist. Surrealism is an artistic style that featured strange, dream-like works. Salvador Dali was a leading surrealist artist. Born in Spain, he died in 1989. In 2011, the museum moved into a new building along the city's waterfront. The Warhol exhibit is the first special exhibit in its new home. Museum director Hank Hine said the exhibit is appropriate to Dali's memory. The exhibit features some of Warhol's famous silkscreens pictures.
North Korea was angry that the movie was made. Its made-up plot is about killing North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un. The movie stars Seth Rogen and James Franco. Their characters are asked by U.S. spies to go to North Korea and kill Kim Jong-un. Experts say North Korea probably led the cyber attack. On Thursday, U.S. government officials were trying to figure out what to do. Thinking Of Response Right now they don't have too many choices.
"These discoveries are happening all the time, and it gets kids excited about science." Cellphones and the Internet are leading to new discoveries in ocean life. Scientists can find out about rare events when people post photos and videos of "strange fish and fish doing strange things," said Philip Hastings. Hastings is a professor at the University of California. "Everyone has a cellphone with a camera on it," Hastings said. Facebook, YouTube and other networks can help scientists get information about rare species. Many people have theories about why the huge fish died. One claim is that the dead oarfish is a sign that an earthquake may happen soon.
Buckets, flowerpots and old tires are perfect places for mosquitoes to lay eggs. Before long, public health officials may have a new tool. A British company called Oxitec Ltd. has a mosquito called OX513A. The mosquito's genes have been changed. For example, in people genes determine what color eyes someone will have. Some people have a gene that makes them likely to get a disease. Which Has A Death Gene Oxitec mosquitoes are all male.
Congress' staff members have often said the new bomber is not necessary. In 2013, they said the government should wait 10 years until technology improves. Lancaster Mayor Parris really wants the bomber to be built. It would bring jobs to the area, including at restaurants, stores and other companies. "It would be so great," Parris said, "to see it all come back."
It is a gene in Tibetan's bodies. It has been passed down for generations and generations. Genes are the building blocks of the human body. They decide what color eyes and hair someone has. Genes can also affect our health. Having certain genes can put someone at risk of diseases. Scientists think EPAS1 gives Tibetans an advantage. It is what makes them better than anyone else at living high up in the mountains.
X-rays let them study the mummies without unwrapping them. The team did not want to damage them. The scans could help the team understand about ancient Egyptians' health. For example, some mummies still have arteries. The artery could show if the person had been healthy or not. The X-rays will also help us imagine what those people were like, said Lisa Cakmak. She helps run the museum. Two mummies got an X-ray.
The U.S. says more than 1,000 people were killed. The U.S. threatened to lead an attack in response. Instead, Syria President Bashar Assad agreed to surrender his poison gas weapons. The places where Syria made poison gas have been destroyed. The next thing to do is get rid of liquid chemicals. Those chemicals are mixed to make poison gas. No country would let the chemicals be destroyed on their land. So the chemicals will be destroyed at sea.
Kajencki spent more than seven years in the Army. He trained soldiers to use missiles to shoot down enemy aircraft. He also was on the staff for a commanding general in Bosnia. He left the military in 2001 to become a teacher. In 2009 he looked into the Troops to Teachers program. Duke University also gave him the chance to earn an advanced degree in education. Kajencki agreed to teach at a poor school in return. "I feel I have the ability to help people succeed," Kajencki said.
It might not make the dogs live longer, Promislow pointed out. However, it may help them stay healthier and more active. That would be good, too. Finding money for the study may be difficult. Dog-food companies might be willing to pay for it. Most of all, the scientists are counting on dog lovers who want their pets to be healthier. The scientists have set up a website about the project. It is dogagingproject.com.
One of the world's richest men created a new contest. Its prize is $1 billion. It sounds crazy, but Warren Buffett knows his money is safe. The winner must pick all the winning teams in the NCAA March Madness men's basketball tournament. They will play 63 games. The chances of knowing who will win each game is 1 in 9 quintillion. It's just about impossible. In January, Tim Chartier heard about the contest.
Many Chinese believe that buildings must face a certain direction for good luck and to keep away evil spirits. Marks said his company has had to turn around buildings and move rides to improve their feng shui. Marks and others in California's theme park industry are happy to learn those rules. China is spending billions on theme parks. Their business is booming and creating many U.S. jobs. American companies earn $500,000 to $7 million to plan a theme park. More detailed construction plans cost up to $15 million. AECOM is an engineering firm near Los Angeles.
Obama said the U.S. will send a team of experts to the African country immediately. Finding the girls is the most important thing, said President Barack Obama. But the extremist group also must be stopped. The goal "is to do everything we can to recover these young ladies," Obama said Tuesday. He called it a "terrible situation." But the world also needs to stop terror groups like Boko Haram. These groups cause chaos in people's day-to-day lives, Obama said. The kidnapping has caused anger around the world.
Encyclopaedia Britannica used to be the king of encyclopedias. It hopes to become the most important encyclopedia again. An encyclopedia has information about many different things. It includes articles on topics like animals, science, countries and famous people. A set could include 32 books. It cost a lot of money, but many people were willing to buy them. They thought Britannica was the best encyclopedia. More than two years ago, the company stopped publishing the books.
Four days after he arrived, he began to feel sick and went to the hospital. The hospital gave him some medicine and sent him home. Now, the man is very sick. Since Sunday, he has been in a special unit at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, said Dr. Edward Goodman. Dr. Tom Frieden is the head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). He said has "no doubt" that Ebola won't spread widely in the United States. "We will stop it here," he said. Ebola is very difficult to get.
Later, about another 75 students walked out of Alameda International High School. They had met with school Superintendent Dan McMinimee. Students were not happy with what he had to say about the new plan. The plan was suggested by school board member Julie Williams. Many conservatives think some schoolbooks say too many bad things about America. They believe that reading such material will change students' thinking. Students, they fear, will become rebellious. They will no longer feel proud of their country.
Lieberthal said the new plan is very promising. By 2050, there could be a lot less pollution, he said. Of course, change may not be easy. The U.S. and China will have to meet their new goals. Scientists say climate change is already a huge problem. It affects life on every continent and in the oceans. Governments must act quickly, they say. Otherwise, the Earth could be damaged.
The spire makes it taller than the Willis Tower which is 1,451 feet tall. The height also means something special. The United States was born in 1776. The new World Trade Center is 1,776 feet tall. They were part of the old World Trade Center. The towers were destroyed in an attack in 2001. The people who designed the new building wanted to send a message with the height. The message was about patriotism and bouncing back.
This slit allows them to be attached to a wooden spear or dart. Waters said the Clovis died out about 12,600 years ago. This was around the same time the boy was buried. Some of the tools buried with the boy were made of elk antlers. Back then, they were very precious. The tools date to the beginnings of the Clovis people, about 13,000 years ago. So, they were 400 years old when the boy was buried. The difference in age, Waters said, suggests the antler tools were kept for generations.
They are closer to the Pacific Ocean, so the ozone reaches them first. Smog has become much worse in California's cities like Bakersfield, Fresno and Los Angeles. It will not be easy to stop pollution from China, said scientist Owen Cooper. The U.S. and China would have to work out a deal. Such an agreement is not likely, said Cooper. The U.S. will have to work harder at stopping the pollution here. Pollution from U.S. cars and factories will have to be cut more. Even if pollution from cars and factories is cut, it will be tough to make a difference.
"We'll work with what we have," said scientist Alan Gould. "We need to make the most of the data that it has already gotten." Since last July, two of Kepler's four gyroscopes have broken. That makes it impossible for Kepler keep a steady focus on a distant star. Engineers will try to bring the gyroscopes back into service. They will also try to find other ways to make the spacecraft work. Kepler has found some planets that cannot support living things. They are either too close or too far away from their suns.
They looked more like soldiers than police. Their weapons made some people more upset. Now, President Barack Obama is ordering new rules. He wants to help fix the relationship between police forces and the communities they protect. Obama has two plans to fix the problem. He wants to control how police get military weapons. He also wants police officers to wear cameras. The president is offering to spend $263 million over three years to train police officers.
Diphtheria is an infection. Lots of people were sick. Twenty mushers and 150 dogs traveled more than 600 miles. They delivered the serum to Nome. The mushers and their dogs rescued several towns. Nina thought Nome was a magical place. "It never occurred to me that I would get there some day. So, for me to be here is a real event in my life," she said.
The government was able to change cafeteria food by passing new rules. Changing packed lunches might be more challenging. The new study may be a good starting point. Not much is known about the nutritional value of packed lunches.
For the past three years, however, farmers in Bangladesh have grown crops in a new way. They have started using something called "vertical gardens." Vertical gardens grow up, instead of flat on the ground. They are made of containers full of soil and vegetables. Still, they can produce a lot of food. The containers are raised above the ground. It protects soil and plants from floods. The gardens can make it through a storm without being destroyed.
But that day would change Dowling's life. He is now part of an effort by the U.S. Special Operations Command. It is trying to produce a new protective suit for special soldiers. The goal is a suit with head-to-toe armor. Live information would be shown inside the helmet. They call it " what else? " the "Iron Man suit." The plan is to make something like Iron Man from the movies, Dowling said.
It helps pay for school meals. More than 30 million students benefit from it. Yet over the past 15 years, the program hasn't changed much. Obama wants to update it as part of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. It has pushed for healthier school meals. It recommends meals containing fewer calories, less fat and salt, and more fruit, vegetables and whole grains. Most parents would agree these are excellent goals. The new law also makes it easier for poor kids and foster kids to have school meals.
He said young people are "often disappointed by facts" that show people are putting "their own interests before the common good." He told people not to get sad or loose hope. "Situations can change, people can change." The pope is a religious leader, not a political one. Protests spread across Brazil last month. People were angry about government greed and dishonesty. They complain the state is spending too much on sports events. They say there are is not enough money for education and health care.
Rescued male panthers often die after their release. Panthers are also called cougars or mountain lions. They live in the forests, prairies and wetlands of Florida. These big cats are carnivores. They are very endangered. Experts believe there are between 100 and 160 panthers living in the wild. "Every panther life is important," said Jennifer Hecker. She runs a Florida wildlife group.
She helps teens. She helps young adults getting their first jobs. She also helps the children of soldiers. Many have come back from war. Their families have no money to spend on clothes. "We are here to give clothes away to kids who need them," Walsh said. She volunteers with children in foster care. She watches out for their rights in court.
An American Airlines flight crashed after taking off from New York in 2001. Smaller airlines have had crashes since then. The last deadly U.S. crash was a plane flown by Colgan Air . The plane crashed into a house near Buffalo, N.Y., on Feb. 12, 2009, according to the AP. The Boeing 777 has been seen as one of the safest aircraft in the skies today. Nearly all of the world's large airlines fly 777s for long routes. It has been a major workhorse for carriers flying from the U.S. to Europe and Asia. More than 1,1000 are in service.
It has operations all over the world. Cocoa makes most kids happy, at least when they eat it as chocolate. But cocoa has a dark side too. Much of the cocoa crop is grown on farms where children work. Big cocoa companies like Cargill are trying to stop child labor abuses on cocoa farms. But, they also want to keep production high. Cocoa is a valuable crop. It sells for a high price and there are more and more buyers.
Maybe that can change now. Some scientists are trying to bring back the passenger pigeon. The bodies of dead animals still hold something called DNA, even if the animals have been dead for a long time. DNA is a set of instructions on how to make a particular animal. If an animal's genes could be recreated, maybe a long-lost species could be brought back to life. That's the idea behind something called de-extinction. It works like this: take DNA information from an extinct animal like Martha. Combine it with the DNA from a closely related species, another type of pigeon.
Six different teams have hired him. He was on the Boston Celtics and the Atlanta Hawks before he joined the Wizards. Collins wrote that he realized he was gay when he was 12. His twin brother was getting interested in girls, but he was not. She was not surprised. She accepted him lovingly. From then on, he knew he would always have support. Collins decided to make his announcement after the bombings at the Boston Marathon.
Since 2008, U.S. oil companies have been selling much more oil. They now sell 3.5 million more barrels of oil each day. There is a group of 12 of the world's biggest oil-producing countries. Most are in the Middle East. A few years ago, fighting started in parts of the Middle East and Africa. Some countries there could not put out as much oil. So other countries pumped more oil. But now the oil group plans to keep pumping oil steadily.
Two baby elephants were born in zoos in Austria and England. It didn't happen the natural way. The babies were artificially fathered with semen taken from wild South African elephants. Semen is a liquid that males release while mating. For the first time, elephant semen gathered in the wild was frozen and given to zoos. Semen was given to two female zoo elephants. The females later had two healthy baby elephants. The new project is known as Project Frozen Dumbo.
Scientists who study planets and space are called astronomers. They have discovered water vapor shooting off its surface. The vapor is like steam that is made when water is heated. The discovery of vapor could tell us something fascinating about the history of our solar system. For the first time, he said, we have discovered water on an asteroid. (As you see, he thinks it's an asteroid.) Ceres sits in a string of asteroids stretching between Mars and Jupiter. It is 590 miles wide.
On Thursday, Scottish voters got the chance to decide whether to become independent. They voted to stay part of the United Kingdom. Scots voted 55 percent against independence. Forty-five percent voted in favor of breaking away from the United Kingdom. They are England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The portion of Scottish voters who showed up was greater than ever before. The vote brought relief to leaders in London, the capital of the United Kingdom The First Minister of Scotland is Alex Salmond.
CUPERTINO, Calif. " Apple is putting a lot of money into sapphire. Instead, it is working with a company to make artificial sapphire crystals. Experts think the sapphire will be used in Apple's touch-screens. Just like the real thing, man-made sapphire is almost impossible to scratch. It also senses the touch of fingers very well.
Farmers do not want to hurt the bees. They know bees are good for their crops. Bees fly from plant to plant. They carry pollen to each one. Many people are worried about the bees. That is why Florida made a new law. The law allows backyard beehives. States like Florida are split up into smaller parts.
Most teenagers are excited for their first day of high school, but Robinson was worried. She had planned to stay with her aunt for a year. But it became five years. A stable home life is important for students. Robinson said she was mostly worried about her parents, not school or her own life. Around her junior year, she realized she was not on the right track. She did not have enough classes to graduate. And she was having trouble in math and science.
The number of reports has shot up since two years ago. Back then, drones were new. Reports were still unusual. The reports are filed with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The FAA has a hard time dealing with drones. Air traffic controllers watch the sky to keep planes from crashing. They usually cannot see drones with radar. Drones made out of plastic are especially hard to spot.
Unbelievable." Akasaki was also called by phone. Yet, the Nobel Prize committee had not yet reached Amano when it made the announcement. He happened to be flying from Japan to France. They are hoping to get a call saying they are the lucky winner. "I think actually they were not prepared for it," said Staffan Normark. He is with the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which runs the Nobel Prize committee. "They had not been waiting all day or all night for this call."
Kids can shop at this store for free. Walsh's main goal is to give free clothes to kids. She thinks every child deserves to wear nice clothes. She helps teens. She also helps the children of soldiers. Many have come back from war. They have not found jobs yet. Their families have no money to spend on clothes.
WASHINGTON " As a new school year begins, American parents should support first lady Michelle Obama. She has a new plan to make school lunches healthier. It is based on science and nutrition. The first lady wants to improve children's health through better eating and more exercise. Many people aren't just overweight, they are obese. Childhood obesity is a national problem: In 2012, 1 in 3 American children were overweight or obese. Overweight children may develop diseases, including heart disease and diabetes. The U.S. has had a national school lunch program since 1946.
The dig is near the famous La Brea Tar Pits. Many fossils have been found in the tar pits over the years. Fossils are the remains of animals and plants from long, long ago. Those ancient bits and pieces can be petrified " over time they turn into something like stone. Paleontologists have recovered various fossils so far: mollusks, sand dollars, pieces of driftwood and cones from Monterey cypress trees. For Scott, two finds are particularly exciting. One is a rock that probably contains a 2-million-year-old sea lion's tooth. The other is a 10-foot limb from an ancient pine tree.
Buddhism is one of the world's biggest religions. Hundreds of millions of people follow the teachings of the Buddha. But one major mystery surrounds Buddhism: exactly when was the Buddha born? A team of archaeologists led by Robin Coningham set out to solve the mystery. They dig in the ground looking for very old objects. It isn't known exactly what day or year the Buddha was born. Historians had thought that he could have been born anytime between 623 B.C. and 340 B.C.
Worn-down buildings display bright murals. The paintings celebrate salmon and urge the fish's preservation. "We are people of fish, we are people of salmon, that is what we depend on," said Tom Tilden. He is the Curyung Tribal Chief. "We want this renewable resource to come back year after year after year so we can continue to be here," he said. The EPA leader toured the mine site with Pebble officials after leaving Dillingham. John Shively heads Pebble Partnership. He told McCarthy the company has good intentions.
Scientists also have two more missions to look forward to. One is called the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS. It will work similarly to Kepler to find possible planets nearby. TESS is scheduled to launch in 2017. It will use its infrared vision to scan TESS's  finds for signs of organic molecules. It is set to launch in 2018.
The pictures were probably created by Warhol on computer disks nearly 30 years ago. The disks, however, were nearly unreadable. That's where a group of Carnegie Mellon University students came in. The students discovered how to get Warhol's pictures from the old disks into a modern computer. But already the new art has excited Warhol fans around the world. That's understandable for one of the world's most famous artists. "It's something that's new," said Matt Wrbican. He is an expert on Warhol at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh.
CHICAGO " Nik Wallenda is a tightrope walker. He has such good balance that he can walk across a thin wire without falling. The wires, or "tightropes," can be set up almost anywhere. The tightropes that Wallenda walks across go between buildings, hundreds of feet above the ground. Sometimes he walks on wires with his eyes closed. Last Sunday, Wallenda broke a world record. He walked across a wire between two huge skyscrapers in Chicago. The wire was about 500 feet above the ground.
He is with Muroc Joint Unified. "We've tried pretty much anything we can think of," Walker said. "We've come up short, sadly." Public school districts usually pay for major repairs with money from property taxes. Part of the tax money goes to schools. Military base schools are on government land, which is not taxed. These schools do not receive any money from property taxes. State Senator Jean Fuller from Bakersfield is a state lawmaker.
Using DNA could make it quicker to track diseases spread by food. Genome Trakr is one program. It wants to map the DNA of 100,000 types of pathogens found in food. The DNA maps allow scientists to tell one type of microbe from another. If microbes can be told apart from each other, disease outbreaks can be stopped faster. The DNA maps will be put online. Scientists and health workers will use them for free. It has already helped stop serious disease outbreaks.
She decided she needed to see the finish, too. Nina read about the 1925 "serum run" as a child. A serum is a medicine. In 1925, towns in Alaska needed the serum to cure diphtheria. Lots of people were sick. Twenty mushers and 150 dogs traveled more than 600 miles. They delivered the serum to Nome. It cured the sickness.
Scientists collected stories from Quinhagak elders about the objects they found. They showed the elders what they had dug up. The elders talked in Yup'ik about the finds. One elder knew the stone used for an ulu blade just by its color. "We only get one shot at it," Knecht said. "These are all pages in the Yup'ik history book." Village leaders work with elders and the scientists. They talk about when to dig, how to preserve the site and what to do with what they find.
But what happens to the older devices they replaced? The old electronics can become a pollution problem. Some contain materials that can be dangerous. There are nearly 50 million tons of electronic junk thrown out around the world each year.
It is a government health agency. Frieden said there are rules for anyone taking care of an Ebola patient. The nurse caught Ebola because the rules weren't followed, he said. The rules say health care workers must wear special clothes that keep them covered head to toe. Frieden said CDC officials have spoken with the nurse. She did not know how she may have caught Ebola. Frieden said a person can get Ebola from even a single mistake. He said it is possible that other health care workers may get Ebola.
They asked the other children to point her out, and fired a bullet into her skull. Two other girls were wounded. The Pakistani government sent Malala to England for treatment. Many politicians called the gunmen "beasts." Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari said it was "an attack on all girls in Pakistan, an attack on education, and on all civilized people." The outcry scared the Taliban. They tried to justify their attack on a child. They ordinarily do not justify their attacks.
Still, there are problems. Crowds of white people do not throw things at black students anymore. There are no rules against black women going to college. Still, many black people find it hard to get a good education. Today, that is no longer true, Obama said, but black students still are not getting a good education. More blacks are finishing high school than ever before. When compared to other races though, a smaller fraction of black students are graduating from high school. They finish high school far less often than other races.
! [](. The creatures are called oarfish. They are shaped like a long, thick, silver ribbons. Scientists are puzzled why the fish washed up on the beaches. But they are excited to have the chance to study the rare animals. Oarfish are a mystery to scientists. They live very deep in the sea.
The report said that the closest adult Asian carp are far away. They are about 55 miles from Lake Michigan. And, no small Asian carp have been seen close either. The closest have been found 131 miles from Lake Michigan. And they've been taken in the canal on the Lake Michigan side of the fence. They show something different. The samples have regularly shown Asian carp DNA during the past four years. DNA contains the codes for the cells in animals bodies.
Because of that, people may listen to tech companies. Apple and others may be able to change ideas about gays. Leanne Pittsford is another fighter for gay rights. "These big tech companies have offices overseas," she said. Cook's announcement could make tech companies do more. They could begin to "get more involved overseas," she said. In the United States, tech companies have long supported gay rights. They still do more than most other kinds of companies.
Other people wanted the library because it would bring jobs to the area. The Chicago Park District approved the plan last week. It said the city would be in charge of the 20 acres, but only if the University of Chicago was chosen by Obama to host his library. The University of Chicago was seen as the most likely spot for Obama's library. The problem was that the university did not own the land it wanted to build the library on. Benjamin Hufbauer wrote a book about presidential libraries. He said a battle like this is normal. There is a long history of land fights involving presidential libraries.
Chavez was accused of shutting down newspapers that said things against him, and of attacking his enemies. He won the election in 2012 by a few votes. He died from cancer soon after. His vice president took over and has kept most of his plans. But many Venezuelans are still angry about their school books and how the books talk about Chavez. They are brainwashing children, said Hector Cuevas. He has a son in the sixth grade. The books change the country's history to how the government wants people to see it, he said.
The decision was very meaningful. The award was shared by a Pakistani and an Indian. Each struggled for children's rights. The countries they represent are neighbors, but not friendly ones. In the past few days bombings have happened on the border between the two countries. Malala is a high school student. After she was shot by the Taliban, she moved to England for medical treatment. She was in school when the prize was announced.
Visitors to California from China usually have good jobs. They make $66,900 a year on average. That is about 13 times more than the average worker in China earns. Store owners in Southern California really try to get Chinese tourists to shop. One of those salespeople is Jeffrey Hsu. He speaks Mandarin, one of China's main languages. He works at the Ugg Australia store. "I think we understand their customs," Hsu said.
No one has tested to see if rapamycin makes people live longer. Experiments on people are expensive. They can take many years to get results. Dogs are another story. "I think it's worth a go," said Steven Austad. He is an expert on aging at the University of Alabama. Rapamycin may not work on dogs, Austad said. "But if it did, boy, it's going to be huge."
They also make sugary drinks. In 2010, first lady Michelle Obama began the "Let's Move" project. The project helps kids lose weight. It encourages them to eat healthier. Obama "focused on kids and kids eating healthy. She brought a lot of attention to it," Popkin said. Everyone has to help kids eat healthy, said a food makers group. It is called the Grocery Manufacturers of America.
As a result, no one paid much attention to it for years. But in 1988, Haggis decided that Azoria might be worth a closer look. What gave Haggis that idea was some Azorian pottery he discovered. The pottery convinced him that the city was much older than people thought it was. Azoria was a small city, with a population of 2,000 to 5,000 people. There had been settlements on the mountaintop of Azoria for centuries. However, a full-blown city did not develop until around 630 B.C. Around 480 B.C., the city was destroyed by a terrible fire, probably set by invaders.
Rishik says that's hard to believe. Over the years, Hollywood has given LA musicians a lot of work. One movie alone can use more than 100 players. For that reason, Hollywood has long attracted some of the world's top musicians. More and more films are shot overseas. As a result, the number of jobs for LA musicians is half what it was five years ago. LA musicians are having a tougher time making a living. Many may soon start looking for work elsewhere.
The country's economy is weak. The government and people have less money, and not enough jobs pay well. In his last speech, Maduro did not say how he would fix it. Instead, he defended Venezuela's socialist government. People cannot buy and sell things on their own easily. The government sets prices for most things people need, including food. Venezuela has been a socialist country since Hugo Chavez was elected president in 1998. Maduro was his vice president.
There were no more of that species, that kind of animal. There have been no passenger pigeons since 1914. Maybe that can change now. Some scientists are trying to bring back the passenger pigeon. DNA is a set of instructions on how to make a particular animal. DNA forms genes, which control how an animal is made " will it have wings or arms, blue feathers or red hair or brown fur? If an animal's genes could be recreated, maybe a long-lost species could be brought back to life. That's the idea behind something called de-extinction.
BEIJING " To Americans, Chinese New Year brings to mind parades and fireworks in Chinatowns across the United States. In China, it involves millions of people returning home. The Lunar New Year festival, or Spring Festival, starts Friday. Chinese workers are expected to return to their home villages. It's a holiday of sharing time and gifts with family and friends. Yet, Chinese New Year has become a busy time of travel. It's the world's most populated country.
They feel it is their duty to save the things that are most precious to Syria's history. Syrian rebels have been fighting against the Syrian government for more than three years. It started in 2011. At that time, people in many Arab countries began to protest in the streets. In Syria, President Bashar Assad used the military to stop the protests. Many people were killed and a civil war began. The war is still going on today. The rebels want Assad out.
But not nearly as many as before the recession. Before the recession, Americans often moved from the snowbelt states for ones in the sunbelt. The snowbelt is a region in the northern part of the United States. Chilly states like Minnesota and New Hampshire are in the snowbelt. It runs from Florida to California. But fewer Americans now make that move south. Young Americans have been particularly cautious about moving. "We're not back to normal," said William Frey.
"He's very quiet and sad sometimes," his mom said from Mexico. "He misses his friends and his home in Berkeley." Classmates asked their teacher why Rodrigo was not allowed to come back. She told them about immigration laws. Many classmates didn't think that it was fair that Rodrigo could not be with his friends at school. So they decided to start the "Bring Rodrigo Home" campaign. "The more we learn about immigration, the more unfair it seems," Scott Kuwahara said. Kyle and Scott want to help their friend get back to California.
"But when I grow up I expect to have good work and buy a house where we can stay permanently." Claudia goes to two different schools each year. She gets straight A's at one. Her grades are lower at the other. It's easy for kids like Claudia to fall behind. Nine out of every 10 children living in farmworker camps drop out of school, says Human Agenda. It is a human rights group. This fall Claudia started eighth grade at Aptos Junior High School.
"USA, USA:" America was placed in the same division with such heavyweights as Germany, Ghana and Portugal. Even so, the U.S. made it out of the first round. The team took Belgium to overtime before being bounced out in the next round. To his credit, American coach Jurgen Klinsmann urged his team to fight it out with the traditional soccer powers. Thanks to scoring from their stars like Clint Dempsey, that often happened. That's much different from American teams in past World Cups. Team USA may be out of this year's tournament, but it didn't go quietly. That could make all the difference in the years ahead.
WASHINGTON " On Tuesday, some lawmakers put out a troubling report about the CIA. Their report detailed how the CIA questions enemies. The CIA is the U.S. agency that spies on groups and countries. Its job is to gather information to keep the U.S. safe. Lawmakers said the CIA hurt prisoners during interviews in a way that is against the law, such as using violence. The CIA claimed that the harsh questioning saved American lives. However, lawmakers said the CIA couldn't give proof of that. On Sept. 11, 2001, a group called al-Qaida attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, killing thousands of Americans.
Scientist Bryan Sykes got hold of two hairs that were from Yetis. He ran tests on the hairs. The results show it may be related to an ancient polar bear. Sykes studied the genes found in the hairs. He compared those genes to ones found in a polar bear jawbone. They were a match. The jawbone is at least 40,000 years old. Sykes said Yetis are not related to modern Himalayan bears.
Personal violence could also jump. Crimes such as beatings and killing could climb by as much as 16 percent, the researchers said. They said that there was strong evidence to link climate change and people fighting. It was true across the world, the researchers added. The study figures the global temperature will rise at least 4 degrees Fahrenheit over the next 50 years. That number is based on information from top scientists who study climates. The researchers also figure that people would not do much to change their ways as the weather shifts. The team examined 60 papers.
Just switching from boiling to frying gives cooks a different dish. So does using a slightly different sauce. This makes it easy for cooks to add lots of new dishes. Also, Chinese diners are fond of family-style ordering, in which everyone shares dishes. That way, it's possible to find things that everyone likes. In addition, people from different parts of China like different kinds of food. Those from Sichuan, for example, like spicy food. On the other hand, those from Shanghai don't.
She posted her work online. In Fiesler's story, Barbie is tougher and more confident. In the new book, Barbie says, "Really good games are made by a team of people. I'm doing some of the coding now, but Steven and Brian are helping, too." Computer engineers, or software engineers, write code to build websites, apps and games. People loved Fiesler's new book, which she called a remix. She got 50,000 visits to her website in just a few days. Before that, she only had 800.
But any samples that need to be checked could be held up. There aren't as many scientists to check them right now. The CDC also has had to stop monitoring flu. That might not seem like a big deal. It kills about 24,000 Americans a year. It is too early in the flu season for many people to be sick. So there is not a lot to test. But some state health departments have been testing samples that otherwise would have gone to the CDC, said Kelly Wroblewski.
Members of each party have more or less the same ideas about running the government. They also have similar goals, and usually vote the same way. The hometown question comes at a time when people really don't like politicians, which is another word for elected officials. Many people think politicians will do anything to get into power. Not many voters approve how Congress is doing. Most voters think the country is going in the wrong direction. Sarah Binder is an expert on Congress. Binder said that many people worry that lawmakers are out of touch with the people in their home states.
The headline reads, "All is forgiven." Over the years, Charlie Hebdo has stirred up a lot of anger. It has published many cartoons and articles that have offended Muslims, Christians and Jews. After the attack, many people in France wore signs that said "Je suis Charlie." They also wanted to support freedom of speech, the right to express thoughts and ideas. On Tuesday, staff members from Charlie Hebdo held a meeting. They explained why they decided to put a cartoon of Mohammad on the cover again. Gerard Biard is the editor in chief of Charlie Hebdo.
They can govern their territory. Recognized tribes decide who is a member. Right now, tribes have to prove they have existed through history. This is not easy for some tribes. Records are missing from the late 1800s to the 1930s, Elliot said. During that time, the U.S. government took Indian children from their families. They put the children in special schools. The government wanted them to forget they were Indian.
Noushin got used to life in America. Bruno Borges is in the class. He is from Brazil in South America. When Bruno was 7, his family moved to Sweden, a country in Europe. "You need to be Always do your best. Kids moving to a new country have to be friendly, Bruno said. They should talk to many people.
George Washington led the Revolutionary Army to victory in 1783. The colonies then became the United States of America. Washington became the first American president in 1789. The Lansdowne is one of the best paintings we have of President Washington. It shows Washington standing in a black velvet suit. This was how he dressed as president. Other pictures show him in a military uniform. The artist painted several copies of the painting.
But that did not mean the football players got along. People who know Martin say that Incognito bullied the younger player. Dolphins coach Joe Philbin suspended Incognito from the team. The story shows that bullying may be more than just a problem in schools. Incognito sent threatening text messages to his teammate, two people familiar with the situation said Monday. The messages were also racist, they said. The people spoke to The Associated Press. They did not want their names used.
The new discovery reveals something important: Pollock didn't paint in one mad burst. He worked hard to make sure all his ideas for the painting made sense. He slowly built up his great painting bit by bit over days (or weeks). That may not match today's idea of the artist. But that's not how artists really are. Pollock was a real-life artist. He thought a lot about "Mural," and he worked very hard.
Many of their designs show "Grendizer." He is a giant war robot from Japanese cartoons. They use Grendizer to make fun of people who follow Lebanon's leaders and their private armies. Kabbani and his brother say many people follow the leaders without thinking. "Many people that were warlords in Lebanon are now ruling the country," Kabbani says. Different groups in Lebanon fought for 15 years. The war ended in 1990. Leaders of armed groups during the war now run Lebanon's government.
The idea is to help African businesses to grow. At the same time, he said, there is another goal: To help American companies make more money buying and selling in Africa. Africa has many valuable natural resources " that is, products of the Earth. Among them are oil, minerals, metals, cotton and various foodstuffs. American companies may soon find many new customers in Africa. Obama made the announcement as he spoke at the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit. The event was the first of its kind. It was also the largest meeting any American president has ever held with African leaders.
Often, such instruments can only be repaired with hard-to-find materials from overseas. String instruments, like violins, violas and cellos, are tricky. They are some of the hardest instruments to keep in good working order. Before Cuba's 1959 revolution, many musicians played string instruments made in Europe. Getting instruments from Western Europe became much more difficult. For many years, Russia provided Cuba with violins and cellos. These days, students must make do with inexpensive violins from China. But Chinese violins often pop strings or have other problems.
ST. LOUIS " Honeybees are in trouble. They are dying in great numbers, and no one is really sure why. One-third of the food we eat depends on pollination by honeybees. Bees carry the pollen from one part of a plant to another. Our food system would not work without the honeybees. Beekeeping groups have held meetings. Scientists have studied the problem. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) makes sure the food system is working correctly.
Since last year millions of sea stars have died. A disease has killed the animals, also called starfish, from Alaska to Mexico. Scientists say they've never seen a disease this bad in the ocean. Sea stars started dying in Washington state in 2013. The deaths spread south. They reached Oregon, California and Baja California.
The group asked them to help prevent child labor. The companies are worried about child labor, the group said. To help limit it, they have developed rules for the growers who supply them with tobacco. Growers have to follow child labor laws. "The conditions are inhumane," said 17-year-old Erick Garcia, of North Carolina. "They should improve them." Garcia has been working in tobacco field since he was 11. Additionally, Garcia said kids should mostly be focused on school and should not be in the fields.
Other times they ate it between meals. It was a snack. That worried the professors. They said pizza can be bad for children. They did not say kids should stop eating pizza, though. Doctors should talk to overweight children about pizza, they said.
Then, they attached the nose into the man's forearm where skin will grow to cover it. Seifalian doesn't know when the nose can be taken from the arm and attached to the patient's face. He is waiting for the government to give him permission. The material Seifalian uses to make body parts is protected. His team is creating other body parts, too. These include parts of hearts and ears. The ears will be tested in India and London later this year. Ears are harder to make than noses, says Dr. Michelle Griffin.
In his last speech, Maduro did not say how he would fix it. Instead, he defended Venezuela's socialist government. In a socialist economy, the government owns many businesses. People cannot buy and sell things on their own easily. Venezuela has been a socialist country since Hugo Chavez was elected president in 1998. Maduro was his vice president. He became president after Chavez died in 2013. Venezuelans have to wait in long lines for sugar, cooking oil, soap, rice and other things.
BERLIN " Where does Winnie-the-Pooh live? If you said the Hundred Acre Wood, you are right. If you answered New York City, you are right too. "Winnie-the-Pooh" is a book by A.A. Milne. In the stories, Pooh lives in a forest with his friends. Sometimes they are visited by their friend Christopher Robin. Christopher Robin was a real boy. He grew up in England.
They were from plants, animals and natural petroleum. The chemicals are not usually found on cloth as old as the cloth the scientists looked at. They believe the chemicals were spread on the cloth before a mummy was wrapped. The chemicals would help protect the body after it was buried. Their work shows that around 4300 B.C., the early Egyptians understood how to mix chemicals together and wrap bodies in cloth. That is about 1,500 years earlier than many scientists had thought they began making mummies. In fact, Buckley said the chemicals they found on the old cloth are similar to the ones the ancient Egyptians were using 3,000 years later. Buckley studies chemicals that were used in ancient cultures.
COMPTON, Calif. " Compton student Edgar Ruelas is in eighth grade. He wants to be the first in his family to go to college. He has some help from talent agents from Hollywood. They help them get jobs. They also help them make good money. Now, they're helping students do well in school. They are mentoring them.
Cafeterias must serve balanced and healthy meals. Parents do not always follow the same rules, though. Cafeteria lunches seem to be healthier than packed lunches. Are the lunches cheap enough for students to buy? Cafeteria lunches for elementary school students were actually cheaper than packed lunches. In middle school, cafeteria lunches were only slightly more expensive. The new study raises interesting questions. Schools have improved the quality of lunches they serve.
For today's champion golfer, there's something just as important as having the right club. That something is statistical analysis. Statistics is a type of math. It involves looking at information, often in the form of numbers, and finding out what the information means. In golf, every move on the golf course is recorded, measured, and studied by experts. The experts can use the information to improve a player's game. Information about a golfer's movements is stored in a computer-based system called ShotLink. Volunteers gather that information during tournaments.
As her husband's time in office ends, she will help plan his library. She will work to make sure the library turns out how she and her husband imagine it. The library will also include records of Michelle Obama's efforts to help the public. One of her most famous projects is called "Let's Move." First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is featured in the library of her husband, President Bill Clinton. An exhibit called "Putting People First" highlights her efforts to improve health care for Americans. Another exhibit includes awards she got for her work in education. First lady Laura Bush played a big part in planning President George W. Bush's library.
And that could get worse, Hutchins said. The White House wants 12 times more energy to come from wind and the sun by 2030. He asked, "If it's not done right, what kind of an impact is that going to have on birds and bats?" Fifty years ago, chemicals were the greatest danger to eagles. And, now, it's wind power. But, he supports wind power. "But it ought to be done right," Hutchins said. It's not helping nature "if it's killing hundreds of thousands of birds and bats annually and if it's killing large numbers of protected eagles."
It began two years ago. In that time, Rork has flown more than 1,000 animals to no-kill shelters in other states. A no-kill shelter will not kill animals. Many shelters will kill animals that cannot be adopted. The shelters are not mean. They just cannot afford to care for all the animals. How are dogs chosen? It comes down to supply and demand.
The Air Force plans to order as many as 100 of the new planes as soon as late spring. Boeing, Northrup and Lockheed have all built planes for the government. They all ended up costing far more than expected. Northrop developed the first B-2 stealth bomber. The original B-2 bomber cost so much to make that the government built just 21 of them. It originally wanted to build 132. Each one cost more than $2 billion. Todd Harrison is an expert on warplanes.
They want their leaders to fit the group's values. In InterVarsity, certain students lead Bible study and prayers. InterVarsity thinks they should believe in Christianity. "I don't think a non-Christian would want to be a leader in a Christian group," Cal State student Jasmine Kim said. Kim felt that it blocked InterVarsity's rights. The disagreement raises tough questions. Should religious groups be held to the same rules as everyone else? Cal State is not alone.
Months ago, Russia sent troops into Crimea and took it from Ukraine. The U.S. and Europe added even more sanctions a month ago. A Malaysian Airlines flight was shot down over Ukraine. Both the U.S. and Europe blamed it on a Russian missile. The fighters are supported by Russia. The sanctions will cost U.S. farms about $1 billion a year. Russian companies are losing much more money than that. Sanctions by Europe and the U.S. have hurt them more, experts said.
The group began 20 years ago, when a drug problem swept the tribe. Young people began sniffing gasoline to escape their problems. Some were as young as 11. Sniffing gasoline is very dangerous. Elders became afraid that all their children would be lost to it. They feared the Warlpiri history and way of life would disappear. When the kids began sniffing gas, the leaders searched for them at night to take them home, they said. However, even after the children were brought home, the kids did not stop.
WASHINGTON " It takes a lot of math and science to drive a race car. NASCAR, the racing organization, wants to show kids how. Recently, NASCAR announced a new project to teach kids the science behind racing. It is called NASCAR Acceleration Nation. NASCAR calls them the three D's of speed " downforce, drafting and drag. Downforce is the downward force created by a moving car. Drafting is the idea that two or more cars move faster when they are lined up one in front of the other. Drag means resistance.
But many of the states that were among the poorest all those years ago still are today. Almost a quarter of families were considered poor in 1959. But families in some states were in much worse shape than others. More than half of the families in Mississippi were below the poverty line. The official line was annual pay of $2,973 for a family of four in 1959. That is like making $23,800 a year today. In 2012, one out of every seven families was in poverty. That's a big improvement from 1959.
Hunting is one way of doing that. At the same time, animal rights groups are trying to stop certain ways of hunting. Maine is the only state other than Alaska where hunters can kill bears with bait, traps and dogs. Voters are being asked if these ways of hunting should be banned. They would only be allowed to protect property, people's safety, or to study bears. "The fact is, you don't need to use these methods to hunt the animals," said Wayne Pacelle of the Humane Society. His group wants to change the hunting rules. "Hunting is supposed to give the animals a chance."
A few others now have the biologists, too. Airports are working harder to keep birds away. It seems to be working. There are more planes and animals around. Osmek traps and moves many birds. His team tags them and takes them away. Some birds are killed. Their bodies go to the Burke Museum for classes to study.
The center has struggled at this for many years. Now it has the Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting model. Call it HWRF. The model has been used for the past six years. But this year, it can accept a lot more information about what's going on up in the atmosphere. The change has already paid off. There have been four storms so far this hurricane season. The predictions about the storms have been slightly better than predictions were last year, said NHC spokesman Dennis Feltgen.
Along with the Mennonites, Amish Americans have been living a traditional way of life for centuries. In 2001, Benjamin Glick was born into a Amish family in Pennsylvania. He soon got very sick. Over five months, his parents took him to 12 doctors. "We were going to lose him," said his father, Amos Glick. Then Benjamin saw a doctor at the Clinic for Special Children in Strasburg. Doctors at the center had seen children like Benjamin before. They discovered that Benjamin had a rare allergy.
Kids may have to spray chemicals or use sharp machetes. Tulane University has been watching child labor in Ivory Coast and Ghana. It published a report about its findings. The report said cocoa companies have failed to meet one major goal: setting rules that would certify if cocoa is free of the worst form of child labor.
One hundred years ago, three out of every 10 Americans were farmers. Every state now runs "cooperative extension" programs at universities. The Cooperative Extension service was created by President Woodrow Wilson in 1914. Back then, more than half the U.S. population lived outside cities and towns. Today only about one in 50 Americans farms for a living.
The Abdulkerimovs are a Tatar family. They have lived in Crimea for generations. Jafer Abdulkerimov is a frail 81-year-old man. He has bright eyes and a steady voice. Abdulkerimov remembers every detail of what happened in 1944. On May 18, 1944, Jafer, his two brothers and his mother were woken at 5 a.m. They were put into trucks with hundreds of other Tatar families. Eventually, they were loaded onto a river boat.
The plague victims were buried in Germany around the time of the Justinian Plague outbreak. The scientists first rebuilt the germ that killed both victims. Then they compared it with other types of bacteria from the same family. These bacteria are found worldwide in animals and humans. The type of bacteria that caused the Justinian Plague is from the same family of bacteria as the Black Plague. Still, the bacteria type that caused the Black Plague is different from the one that caused the Justinian Plague. In fact, the type that caused the Justinian Plague was even deadlier. The scientists believe the type of bacteria that caused the Justinian Plague no longer exists.
They did not protect the players, he said. He added that rules still have not been changed to prevent fighting. The lawsuit says the NHL hid the risks of concussions from the players. A concussion is a brain injury. The lawsuit said that because of the NHL's actions, players were at a much higher risk for developing health problems. These include memory loss and trouble thinking. Players even could have brain-related diseases because of the league's actions, the lawsuit said. Some argue that the NFL case is different than the NHL case.
It is like that because the center of the Earth is mainly made of iron. The huge chunk of iron creates a magnetic field. It acts just like a giant magnet. People use geomagnetism too. The metal needle is attracted to the North Pole, which is the end of the Earth's magnetic field. Sea turtles use geomagnetism to guide themselves. What scientists did not know was how turtles find the same beach where they born. Scientists did a new study in Florida to find out.
He is a civil rights leader and was one of King's closest friends. King was 35 years old when he won. He became the second black American to win the peace prize and the youngest. King fought for black people to be treated equally. It was against the law for blacks and whites to sit and eat together in public. The prize was not important just for King. It was also important for the city of Atlanta. Some say it changed the city.
Then they get a four-year degree. Right now, more people go to a four-year college or university. But four-year state universities are expensive. In the past 30 years, the cost has almost tripled. Obama says this is a big problem. People who go to college earn more money. Two-year colleges are cheaper than four-year universities. Every state charges a different price.
Even President Barack Obama had something to say about it. The announcement of the fines came just hours before a game. The Clippers would play the Golden State Warriors. The NBA gets a lot of money from businesses. Several companies decided they didn't want to support the team. The companies were very angry about the comments. The tapes were released just over the weekend. But Sterling has been in trouble before.
"A Yes vote means so much to my generation." The Yes camp is ahead in almost every age group. But it is behind among people who are older than 60. Six out of 10 older people are expected to vote to stay in the United Kingdom. Older people are usually more likely to vote. So the Yes camp has been working hard to get young people to vote. Interest in the vote is sky high. Eight out 10 people may vote.
He broke the news to church members at the Palm Sunday service. The killings happened as Jews were getting ready for Passover. The holiday marks the freedom of the Jewish people from slavery in Egypt 3,300 years ago. The killings also came as Christians were observing Palm Sunday. That the killings happened around these celebrations makes it "all the more painful," Obama said. Police have arrested Frazier Glenn Miller, 73. He's believed to be the shooter. Civil rights groups say Miller has ties to the Ku Klux Klan.
If even six children out of 100 do not get the shot, the disease spreads faster and faster. Last month, Heather Robinson took her 15-month-old daughter for the measles shot. The girl broke out into a rash that covered every inch of her body. "It was even in her ears," said Robinson. "I was totally freaking out." Robinson thought her daughter had come down with the measles. The rash was not the disease. But it was caused by the shot.
Taddy Pettit, 10, from Illinois, asked his stepfather, Ryan Rogiers. Rogiers graduated from the California Culinary Academy. He is a cooking instructor at a community college in Illinois. Pettit's winning recipe was "Black Bean Wrap with Jicama-Grilled Corn Salsa." The trip was his first to the nation's capital. Pettit, who wore a pin-striped suit and a white shirt with no tie, said the White House was "amazing." He said the first lady was "really nice." Pettit also really liked a balloon artist.
The principals said they wanted help to keep They also wanted children to read on the weekends and during the summer. "There's definitely a great need in Tarrant  County," said Emily Furney. She is with the United Way of Tarrant County. "We'd love to be able to provide these resources for all of our schools," she said.
You visit your doctor, and within minutes he knows exactly which virus or bacteria is making you sick. This allows him to give you the right medicine right away. How does he find out so quickly and easily what is wrong with you? First, he uses something like a Q-tip. Then he places it in a tiny box. A few minutes later, he knows what's giving you the sniffles. Sure, it sounds like something from "Star Trek." But it may be common within 10 years, says scientist Elizabeth Wheeler.
Women are not allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia. Lina says basketball is becoming more popular. The girls like making friends. They get to be part of a team. Basketball players wear loose clothes. They can even wear an abaya. An abaya is the long dress all Saudi women must wear. It is very loose.
Republicans want a smaller government. Democrats want a bigger one. Democrats think the government can help solve people's problems. Republicans think people should be left alone to make their own decisions about some things. He is the first person to run and win as a Whig in that city in 157 years. His victory brought national attention to the party. Hundreds of new members signed up. Maryland is also a Whig hot spot.
Workers at the Danish zoo said they had no choice but to kill the giraffe. The reason why is complicated. They said its genes were too much like the genes of other giraffes. All plants and animals have genes. Genes are passed down from parents. They determine eye color, hair color, athletic ability, health and more. If an animal species' genes are too alike, it can be more likely to become sick or have certain flaws. The animal species may become weaker.
Obama called Erevia, Rodela and Morris personally. He told them on the phone that they would receive the honor. He also called family members of recipients who had died. Morris, 72, was one of the nation's first Green Berets. They handle important and difficult missions. Obama said that when he called Morris, "his first reaction was, ‘Oh, my God, what have I done?' When I told him it was all good, the Medal of Honor, I could hear through the phone he almost passed out."
The avocados at your grocery store may have traveled a long way to get there. Mexico sells the most avocados in the United States. There are other areas that sell avocados in the U.S. as well. California, Peru and Chile all sell millions of avocados in the United States. Colombia, a country in South America, is hoping to get into the American avocado business. Colombia already grows a lot of avocados. But Colombian companies are not allowed to sell avocados in the United States. Soon, that may change.
They work with two Compton schools. Students visit William Morris in Beverly Hills. It is a Hollywood agency. It works with stars like Ben Affleck, Oprah Winfrey and Justin Timberlake. "At first I was pretty nervous about meeting WME. I was scared. I didn't really know any mentors," said Edgar. He goes to Whaley Middle School.
Ukraine used to be a part of the Soviet Union, a large country that included Russia. It split into several countries in 1991. Some Russian-speakers in Ukraine want the country to join Russia again, but many fear it. The disagreement has caused dangerous protests in Ukraine. A new government was put in place temporarily while Ukrainians wait for elections. The television tower near the Zakharova's barn is important. The people who want to be part of Russia went to the television tower. They had gunmen change all the T.V.
Many feel his weight loss is very important. It is not just a simple question of Christie looking and feeling better. People worry that being overweight would hurt Christie's chances of becoming president. Our country is obsessed with weight. An overweight person running for president would draw a lot of unwanted attention. Many would feel he or she was not healthy enough for the job. They would point out that being overweight can cause many illnesses. Others would feel that an overweight person just does not look like a "real" president.
The new study found big differences between cafeteria food and packed lunches. For example, cafeteria lunches had much more fruit than packed lunches. They also had more vegetables and meat. In other words, home-packed lunches were missing a lot of important food groups. The answer: junk food. Average packed lunches for elementary school students included large amounts of sugary drinks. They also included chips and dessert. Cafeteria lunches do not come with these treats.
They consider homosexuality a sin. They think that people choose to be homosexual and are not born gay. Christie does not. Christie was asked about signing the bill at an event on Monday. He referred reporters to a written statement. Christie's office also gave out a 2011 video. It showed the governor being interviewed about homosexuality on CNN. He was asked if homosexuality is a sin.
The rules stirred up strong feelings in the black community. For hundreds of years, black women have argued over what is "good" or "bad" hair. Jacobs, who is black, decided to fight. She began a petition to change the new rules. The new rules are unfair, the petition says. They punish the 26,000 black women in the Army. Many black women have very curly hair. They can't always wear it in the same hairstyles as white women.
He said tribal leaders wanted the government to stop checking into money being made on Indian land. The tribes have their own land. They also have their own nations. They aren't totally under the power of the government. They can make laws and have their own leaders. The tribes think it's unfair for the government to look into how they run their land, he said.
Students in Thailand are imitating the "Hunger Games" movies. They are using the hand signal from the movies to ask for more freedom. It has arrested young people for using it. Three students were arrested in a movie theater showing "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay " Part 1." The day before, five other students were also arrested for using the three-finger sign. "Mockingjay" is based on the "Hunger Games" books.
Companies that make and sell the new tag say more and more people are buying them. The tags record how deep the fish go. They measure the temperature of the water the sharks swim in. That information is all useful to scientists. He explained that most sharks don't hang out near the surface of the ocean in direct sunlight. So scientists have programmed the solar-powered tags to get information for about half a year while running on regular batteries. After that time, the tags float to the surface of the ocean. "Now it's exposed to sunlight," Shivji said.
The electrified section of canal is about 30 miles downstream from Lake Michigan. That's in a suburb of Chicago. Some barges traveling through it carry materials that could catch on fire. And sparks could fly between barges. They want the canal physically plugged. They say it's necessary to stop the Asian carp. Josh Mogerman works for the Natural Resources Defense Council. It's a group that tries to protect nature.
It makes the streets safer for walkers. The city has also blocked off some streets to make walking areas where cars are not allowed. San Francisco has a Walk First program. The plan will try to make dangerous intersections safer. They made fun of distracted walkers on April Fools' Day in 2012. The city painted lanes on the sidewalk for people staring at their phones. They called the lanes "e-lanes." Not everyone got the joke.
WASHINGTON " The government shutdown means many people are not working at some important federal agencies. Their absence makes it harder to protect Americans' health and safety. It is more difficult to look into the cause of accidents at work and on the roads and trains. A case of salmonella in chicken is the latest example. Salmonella is bacteria. It makes people very sick. More than 270 people across 18 states have gotten sick from the chicken.
Earlier this year workers began the task. The mural was dirty and had some damage. It took several months to clean and repair the painting. The mural was officially unveiled last Wednesday. She hopes the mural will remind young students about history. She also hopes that it might help bring black students to UCLA. Fewer than four out of every 100 undergraduates at the university last fall were African-American. Some people believe that is too few.
He gave them some wise advice. "Here's what I want you to do," the famous chef said. "Don't cut yourself." Vetri gave the cooking demonstration at the new Culinary Literacy Center. It opened Monday. The program is the first of its kind. It mixes cooking with reading, math and science. Its home is a sparkling new kitchen in Philadelphia's Central Library.
Up there, the air contains about half as much oxygen as is found lower down. Scientists already knew that EPAS1 helped Tibetans do well up in the mountains. Now they also knew where it came from. Scientists still don't know exactly how EPAS1 works. In other words, they know what happens to pretty much everyone except Tibetans. The bodies of people without EPAS1 react to the low level of oxygen by producing a lot of red blood cells. Too many, in fact. Having too many red blood cells can lead to various diseases.
Some gun owners and their supporters said that their opinions were ignored when the laws were made. Morse said he would continue to fight for gun control. He thinks that the laws he made make Colorado safer. Morse said that this was worth the sacrifice of losing his job. Giron told her supporters that "this will make us stronger." She said that she has no regrets about voting for the laws. "I'm a fighter," she said. "We will win in the end, because we are on the right side."
That goes for rich parents as well as poor ones. But poor parents do this more often, researchers say. And their kids suffer from it in ways science is just beginning to understand. This is called harsh parenting. It can change the way their brains work. It increases the chance that they will behave badly, for instance. They also may develop serious health problems. "This is an incredibly important public health issue," said Joan Luby.
CHICAGO " The trouble started on Facebook. "Do you have a problem with me?" one teenager wrote on the other's page. Marquita Riley and Aaliyah Hudson ended up in Manley High School's "peace room." People in school said that the two girls were going to fight. Aaliyah did not want a fight. She could get suspended for 10 days. So she went to the peace room.
Now it has come roaring back. Demand is nearly bottomless for works by modern masters like Picasso and Matisse. In London, Sotheby's and Christie's are both putting modern works up for sale next week. The artworks will be auctioned. Prices are predicted to be high. At least $650 million worth of art is expected to sell. Sotheby's put its pieces on view in London this Thursday. There was quite a bit of red visible, especially in the most highly valued works.
It "does not make for a more peaceful, happier child." Recently, Kavanaugh and about 30 of her fifth-grade students attended a meeting. It had been called to discuss a bill that would outlaw school spankings in Missouri. A bill is sort of a test-run for a new law. This particular bill was introduced by State Senator Joe Keaveny. "We need to stop" hitting "our kids," Keaveny said. Missouri is one of 19 states that still allows spanking in schools. The latest states to outlaw it were New Mexico in 2011 and Ohio in 2009.
It may also be to blame for an increase in earthquakes in the area, because of irrigation. A group of scientists found that the mountains closest to the Central Valley were rising faster than expected. They were rising by about 1 to 3 millimeters a year. That added up to about half a foot in the past 150 years. They believe the mountains are rising because groundwater is being pumped out. Groundwater is very heavy. It pushes down on the Earth's upper crust like a weight. When the weight is removed, the Earth springs upward.
"I think my job is terribly important," Walters said. The goal is to make the papers available to everybody in the world Daniel Weinberg owns The Abraham Lincoln Book Shop in Chicago. Recently, he told Stowell about 45 Lincoln papers in the shop. Are there still important Lincoln papers to be found? Weinberg asked. Every once in a while, he said, something important turns up. Weinberg called Lincoln a true genius.
The trade blocks are meant to punish Russia for taking over the Ukrainian region of Crimea in March. Russia sees Crimea as part of Russia. Until 1954 it was part of Russia. Over half of the Crimeans consider themselves Russian. There were people from many other counties on the plane. The U.S. and some European countries blamed Russia. They said the rebels shot down the plane with a Russian missile. NATO spokesman Nico Tak said that Russia wants to help the rebels win the war.
Messages that pass between the computers are signals. They can be words, pictures or sounds. Signals travel the Internet about 10 times slower than the speed of light. Often, they are 100 times slower. Right now, a signal takes a second to travel from San Francisco to New York. If it were traveling at the speed of light, it would take just 27 milliseconds. A millisecond is one-thousandth of a second. Now, musicians in the same town can jam together online.
It was launched Wednesday morning. The drone safely flew above the Atlantic Ocean and landed on an aircraft carrier called the _George H.W. Bush_. The drone used an advanced computer system. It talked with the carrier's computers to find out what speed to use. The computers told the plane how the wind was blowing and everything else it needed to know. It was able to get this information from miles away. The drone got to the deck of the carrier shortly before 1:45 p.m. A hook on the plane grabbed a wire on the deck.
Vaccines, or shots, are important. If a baby gets a vaccine for pneumonia, she will probably not get that disease later on. How can poor countries lower child death rates? There is no one way that works everywhere. In Nepal, thousands of female health volunteers visit homes. They provide vaccines and information on baby care. In Peru, more women are giving birth in hospitals. Things like clean water and better roads are important everywhere.
It sends the wrong message. People think cigarettes can't be bad if they can be bought in the same place as medicine. Other companies have made similar moves. Starbucks doesn't let people smoke near its coffee shops. Target stopped selling cigarettes almost 20 years ago. The company said it didn't make much money from cigarettes. People stole them. Also, people under 18 can't buy cigarettes in most states.
Right now, though, scientists aren't sure how to remove the PPCPs. Klaper and her team looked for PPCPs in Lake Michigan. The testing was done during two years. The researchers looked near Milwaukee's two main wastewater treatment plants. This is water from sewer pipes that feed into the lake. Sewage contains a lot of feces and urine. It also contains things poured down the sink. Thus, it carries a lot of the chemicals humans swallow and use.
GLASGOW, Scotland " On Thursday, Scotland will vote on whether it should become an independent country. For more than 300 years, Scotland has been part of the United Kingdom. Now, Scotland may separate. Scottish families are talking about how they will vote. Families are divided over the question. Most people older than 60 years old support staying in the United Kingdom.
Now, those foods won't be getting to the dinner table in Russia. Russia said Wednesday it will block many European and U.S. foods. The food won't be allowed in Russia. It will put "trade sanctions" in place for one year. They include all meat, fish, fruit and vegetables. Dairy products like milk, yogurt and cheese are also blocked. Russia's action could hurt U.S. farms. Salmon from Washington state will not be allowed in Russia.
She is the widow of Robert F. Kennedy. The three climbed a flight of stairs to where President Kennedy is buried. Robert F. Kennedy was the former president's brother. He served in the president's cabinet. First lady Michelle Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton were also at the cemetery. As Secretary of State, Clinton worked with the governments of other countries. The Clintons and the Obamas placed a large wreath of white flowers in front of the gravesite. The gravesite is marked by a flame that never burns out.
He works for the University of California, Los Angeles. The study involved mostly Hispanic students. They applied to one of three top schools in Los Angeles from 2007 to 2010. The three schools chose their pupils randomly. They weren't chosen based on grades or test scores. Most of the other students went to worse schools. Until high school, the students did about the same in school. After a year, scientists could see a different.
Levant is the English term for the region stretching from southern Turket through Syria to Egypt. The group has also been called the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). ISIL has taken over huge chunks of land in Iraq and the nearby country of Syria. Its fighters have declared the land to be their own country and made Islam the religion. ISIL fighters captured the Yazidi city of Sinjar. Tens of thousands of Yazidis escaped to Mount Sinjar. Iraqi Yazidis could die in large numbers, President Barack Obama said. The United States is dropping water and food to Yazidis in danger of starving.
People rushed over to help. Amanda called their mom. "You do not think this is ever going to happen," their mom said. Shark attacks are very rare. Ryan remembers the feeling after the shark attack. His arm hurt. He thought about just one thing. He wondered if he would surf again.
It could make Congress angry. Some members already don't trust Obama. But Obama still needs help from Congress. He wants to pass a law to help people who have come to America illegally find ways to become citizens. "Let's get it done. It's time," he said.
That is a big change from 1990. Then, just one out of three people over 5 spoke another language. In 2012, kindergarteners in California were tested in English. Very few of them passed. They said children should not be tested so young. They also said the test was too hard. Alison Bailey teaches at the University of California. Children can speak two languages well, she said.
Some were serious about it. Others were not. Using Los Angeles as a threat works. In the last 20 years, 27 NFL stadiums have been built or fixed up. The last time someone almost came to Los Angeles was in 1996. Ken Behring owned the Seattle Seahawks back then. He wanted a new stadium. The team starting working out in Los Angeles, for a week.
This new rule has upset some parents. They think the teachers should talk about the events in Ferguson. They say their children can learn from what happened. Teachers can use the subject to teach about the police and court systems. School officials say the problem is that teachers have not always stuck to the facts. Teachers give students their own opinions about what happened. The feelings of teachers have caused anger among parents and students, according to a letter to teachers. This anger is not healthy for the community, the letter said.
Marcie wanted to help. Marcie decided to start raising her own bees. She has a big yard. She lives in Florida. Marcie thought it would be a great place for bees. Marcie built 12 hives. Then she got some bad news. She found out her beehives were against the law.
He teaches at Oklahoma State. He used to explore Mars with drones. Now he wants to use them to look at tornadoes. Jacob wants to figure out tornadoes. It's a safer way to track tornadoes. That's a big deal for people who study them. Three storm chasers and scientists just died in a tornado. The governor of Oklahoma set up a group to study drones.
It was made by Cuban-American artist Jorge Rodriguez-Gerada. The title is taken from one of the nation's best-known mottoes. In English, "E Pluribus Unum" means "Out of many, one." You can find it on coins and dollar bills. The motto is also a reminder that even though Americans are different in some ways, they are united. The artwork expresses the same idea. To design the face, Rodriguez-Gerada photographed 30 different young men of different races. He then mixed their faces, taking pieces from each.
They said they expected to live from 16 to 200 years old. Researchers then checked in with them from time to time over seven years. They asked the young people whether they committed any new crimes. The teens who did not expect to live very long committed the most crimes. Alex Piquero studies crime at the University of Texas at Dallas. He led the study. People should not say these kids are all bad and will be bad forever, Piquero said. Letting kids know that their lives can change makes a big difference.
The current first lady, Michelle Obama, is a good example. As her husband's time in office ends, she will help plan his library. She will work to make sure the library turns out how she and her husband imagine it. The library will also include records of Michelle Obama's efforts to help the public. It helps children with their nutrition and health. First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is featured in the library of her husband, President Bill Clinton. An exhibit called "Putting People First" highlights her efforts to improve health care for Americans. Another exhibit includes awards she got for her work in education.
SAN JOSE, Calif. - NASA's Kepler spacecraft has broken down far away in the galaxy. It was on a mission to hunt for new planets. That mission is probably over. Scientists have only begun to dig through the huge amounts of information from the damaged Kepler. They hope to find proof of another planet like Earth. "The signals are there," said NASA's William Borucki. "We have to search for them."
"Do the right thing," violinist Neil Samples said. "Bring the music home." What LA musicians do, he added, is very important. It has a lot to do with the "success of any film that's produced here." Not long ago there were rallies against Marvel Studios. LA musicians accused Marvel of doing the same thing Lionsgate is doing. Marvel hired musicians in London to play the music for American movies. Among those movies were "The Avengers" and "Iron Man 3."
The staff will go through other cases, he said. They could find something that was missed earlier. "When that's the case, it's harder to start" later than earlier, Braden said. The shutdown is beginning its second week. It started Oct. 1 when Republicans in Congress and the White House failed to agree on a law to pay for the government. The CDC isn't the only agency that's strained. The shutdown also affects the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). The agency has stopped its regular mine safety inspections.
His design had a large room with a skylight to let the sun in. There was a fountain with a waterfall. He added private showers and toilets. He also designed a healing center right in the middle of the building, with many windows. They designed a prison cell with a computer to talk with their families. Their prison cell also had lots of light. "In order to work on yourself you have to be comfortable," Gillis said. On the final day of the class, the men made models of their designs.
The U.S. used air attacks against ISIL in Iraq earlier this summer. But Obama did not want to get the U.S. in any deeper. Now, Obama plans to go ahead with the airstrikes in Iraq and Syria. It will be "a steady, relentless effort to take out ISIL," he said. Partners of the U.S. will fight on the ground. Obama wants to give money to rebels fighting Syria's government. The money would train them and buy them weapons. The White House said Wednesday that it will give $25 million to the Iraqi government.
The cleanup will be expensive. Right now, coal provides two-thirds of China's power. Coal also causes at least half of China's pollution. Ma said that reducing pollution is possible. Many countries were invited. The Chinese government made a huge effort to clear the air. By the time of the meeting there were blue skies. China did it by shutting down polluting factories.
"We can't have a fit. We've got to have a movement," he said. Sharpton had strong words for  protesters who stole from stores. For nearly two weeks after Brown's death, protesters " both peaceful and violent " demonstrated in anger over Brown's death. "A fit " you get mad and run out for a couple of nights," said Sharpton. "A movement means we've got to be here for the long haul." He said it's time to "turn oour chance into change" and into new laws. Other speakers talked about the need for black people to vote.
They all believe in "the power of education." Charlayne Hunter-Gault and Carlotta Walls LaNier were two of the women who joined Obama. Both had to fight hard just to go to school. During the 1960s, Hunter-Gault was one of the first black students to study at the University of Georgia. During the 1950s, LaNier was one of a group of black high school students known as the Little Rock Nine. They were not allowed to go to Little Rock Central High School in Arkansas. At the time, Little Rock only had white students. LaNier later became the first black woman to graduate from the school.
But South Florida's reefs have been doing very badly for years. Pollution is to blame. Higher water temperatures hurt too. Many people worry that the reefs might die out completely. There have been no big storms for a while. And no big ships have hit the reefs. This has stopped reefs from dying out more. They have even grown larger in some places.
BEIJING " The search for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane is almost over. A yellow submarine will make the last try to find it. The plane disappeared a month ago. Now, search parties are about to call off the searches on the ocean surface. Instead, they are sending a small submarine underwater. A submarine is like a boat that can go under the sea. Many submarines have people on board to steer them, but this submarine is a robot.
About 10,000 people were in the crowd. Four people have been killed since the protests started on May 28. Doctors believe that 5,000 people have been injured. About 13.9 million people live in Istanbul. It also spreads over two continents. One half of Istanbul lies in Europe, while the other half sits in Asia. The city is connected by bridges across one of the busiest waterways on the planet, the Bosporus Strait. Istanbul is an important city for trade.
It is known now as the Antikythera Mechanism. Scientists and people who study math are excited about the Antikythera Mechanism. That was not always the case. When it was first found, archaeologists were more interested in other things from the sunken ship. The old ship was found off the Greek island of Antikythera. The ship had items like life-size statues of warriors and horses. Scientists know now that the piece of metal was the biggest treasure of all. The metal is actually a tool.
And that is the problem, scientists say. The world is becoming warmer. Many scientists blame humans. When we burn gas, oil or coal it releases gasses. In the future, it could mean that California may get too much rain and too little snow during the winter. Scientists think that by the year 2100, more than half of the snowpack could disappear. Still, California is expected to get as much water as ever. The amount may even increase.
The reason why is complicated. They said its genes were too much like the genes of other giraffes. All plants and animals have genes. They play a big part in what animals and plants look and act like. They determine eye color, hair color, athletic ability, health and more. If an animal species' genes are too alike, it can be more likely to become sick or have certain flaws. The animal species may become weaker. It might not be able to change with its environment.
And they can use them to go on the Web. But they can only view things their parents allow. Fuhu is working on a new tablet, called the DreamTab. This was built together with DreamWorks Animation. The DreamTab will be released this month. The DreamTab comes with lots of videos and games. These are based on popular DreamWorks movies. Among those movies are some very big hits: "Shrek," "Kung Fu Panda" and "Madagascar."
But Putin also said trust between him and Obama is growing. He welcomed Obama's willingness to work with Russia. The two countries are working on a plan to deal peacefully with Syria's supply of poison gas. Syria would give up the gas. Avoiding force in Syria will strengthen the trust between Russia and the United States, he wrote. "It will be our shared success and open the door to cooperation on other" important problems. The article was published in the newspaper's opinion section. The section is separate from where the news is published.
_Eric H. Holder is attorney general of the United States. President Barack Obama named him to run the U.S. Department of Justice. One of the Department of Justice's duties is to make sure that all people are treated fairly under the law. The following is a letter written by Holder for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, adapted by Newsela._ Since the Aug. 9 shooting death of Michael Brown, the nation and the world have seen the angry protests in Ferguson, Missouri. People protesting want answers about how this young man died.
Experts know how to solve the weight problem. People have to eat less. They also need to buy less food. McPherson says that people should go back to weighing what they did 30 years ago.
One of the them was the city of Raqqa in north-central Syria. Many ISIL fighters are in Raqqa. The strikes were carried out by different aircraft including fighter jets and bombers. The U.S. military also used drones. Tomahawk missiles were fired from U.S. Navy ships. The ships were in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea. Five countries aided in the strikes. They were Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, the United States said.
In that time, Rork has flown more than 1,000 animals to no-kill shelters in other states. A no-kill shelter will not kill animals. Many shelters will kill animals that cannot be adopted. They also kill the animals when the shelter is full. They just cannot afford to care for all the animals. How are dogs chosen? It comes down to supply and demand. Up North, for instance, there aren't enough puppies.
The woodrats in Bergen County now live far away from other woodrats. For this reason, they are only able to mate with each other. This has weakened them, and made them less able to fight off disease. Mick Valent is a zoologist. His goal is to help save the woodrats of the Palisades by making them healthier. He may even bring woodrats from other states to breed with the New Jersey colony. Raccoons are one main reason that New Jersey woodrats are in danger. Raccoons often have a type of worm living inside them.
"Sometimes we get 150 or even 160 tons in a day." The algae is called hutai in China. It grows wild in summer when days are longer and the sun is high in the sky. High levels of chemicals in the water can kickstart the growth. He said those chemicals might get stirred up from deeper in the ocean. Or they could be brought by dirt from farms, golf courses and gardens washing into the sea. But once the seaweed starts growing, it's hard to stop it. In general, the plant isn't dangerous.
Gay marriage supporters won big at the U.S. Supreme Court Wednesday. The court said that a nationwide law that ignores legal gay marriages had to go. Several states allow gay people to marry, but they were not getting certain government rights. The court also made it possible for California to allow gay marriage again. The court did not decide if the Constitution promises a right to same-sex marriage. Twelve states allow same-sex marriages. California will start again soon. President Barack Obama praised the court.
Some members of the government have held up plans to change immigration laws. About 200 people a year die trying to cross the Sonora Desert, which runs along the border with Mexico. So Medina wants immigration law changed soon. The government is split into two parties that often have different political beliefs. They tend to believe it should be easier to come to the United States. Another party is the Republicans. Many of them think it should be harder to come live in the United States. Some famous Democrats have dropped by Medina's tent to lend their support.
Barnett had been a manager of music stars. He also worked with singer Adele and the popular boy band, One Direction. Barnett has been a fan of Capitol's artists since he was a kid growing up in England. He liked the Beatles and Beach Boys. Singer Sam Smith said he met with many record companies before he signed on with Capitol. He said he liked how Capitol respected him and his music. It was a done deal when he met Barnett, he said. Barnett also liked Sam Smith.
Change the radiation limits for long-distance space travel? No go, the report said. Relaxing the safety rules would not be good. NASA might allow special cases, the committee said. They should also follow the guidelines. The agency should offer lifetime health care for its astronauts. Also, different astronauts may have different levels of risk. NASA should constantly check the astronauts.
They were there to test a new way of studying the biggest killer of beach swimmers: rip currents. Water piles up between the beach and a line of raised sand in the ocean. Then the water finds a low point in the line of sand and rushes back out to sea. Sometimes swimmers are carried along with the flow. While studying the riptides, the scientists dragged yellow-and-green objects into the waves. The plastic and foam devices are known as "drifters." They are called drifters because they drift into the ocean and back to the shore with the waves. The scientists then walked along the beach to wherever the drifters washed up on the beach.
He also has a second-degree burn on his right foot, he said. "They don't seem to care," he said about his employers. "It's horrible how they manage us, how they talk to us, how they treat us. They don't respect us as human." Restaurants used to hire mostly younger people just trying to earn pocket money. Now, workers are older. They depend on the work to feed their families. Research shows that the average age of minimum-wage workers is now 35, and that most of them are 20 and older.
West Germany was capitalist. People there had the right to own homes and buy and sell things as they liked. They also had the freedom to say what they wanted. East Germany was communist. East Germans didn't have much freedom during this time. They couldn't travel freely or speak out against their government. Klaus-Jurgen Warnick was one of those East Germans. He remembers November 1989, when crowds of East Germans came to the wall, demanding to be let through.
It depends on "what sort of situation they're in or what sort of situation their country is in," he said. "Hamlet" is the story of Prince Hamlet of Denmark. Hamlet is son of the king and heir to the throne. He is off studying in Germany. Hamlet must decide what to do about this.
This setting makes the movie seem very realistic, said the film's director, Bob Noll. "Looking in every direction you feel you're in the past." A special 360-degree camera was used to film the battle scenes. This was actually nine digital cameras attached to a metal tube. During filming, Noll and the camera operator huddled inside this chamber. All around them, re-enactors shot blanks at each other. The battle was carefully mapped out in advance. A coordinator helped design the re-enactors' moves.
Its official name is the Safe Carry Protection Act. But anti-gun groups call it the "guns everywhere bill." In March, Georgia lawmakers passed the gun bill. It is waiting for the governor's signature. The bill has attracted national attention because it lets people carry guns in so many places. The National Rifle Association is the national pro-gun group. The NRA wants people to be able to own and carry guns. The group called the bill a "historic victory for the Second Amendment."
Scientists will look in Ethiopia north of where Lucy was found. They will look in rock that is between 2.5 million and 3 million years old to find human bones. We hopefully will find fossils of early humans. They might be able to link Lucy with more human-like ancestors. Do you agree? There are thousands of fossils of early humans that have not really been studied. They will tell us what these early humans ate and other things about their lives. Areas all over Africa have not been thoroughly explored.
Last year, there were 319 million. Another problem is that the Chinese army controls 80 percent of the skies. And that airspace is reserved for military planes only. In the U.S., only 17 percent of airspace is controlled by the government. Flights are spaced about 7 to 10 miles apart. This means only 20 to 40 planes can land on a runway every hour. In the U.S., 60 per hour can land. China is a huge country, and full of mountains.
Lipnitskaia won the highest women's score in the short and long program over the past three days. She is also a favorite to win a gold medal in next week's ladies singles event. In the singles event, she will skate without a team. Russia has a long history of winning pairs, ice dancing and men's skating. She tried to explain how it felt to skate so well on the world's biggest stage. "I don't know how to explain the feeling I had out there,'' she said. "I'm very happy to have helped win the first gold medal for Russia. I got nervous in the middle of the program, I'm not sure why, it's completely unlike me, so the jumps weren't great in the second half, I didn't feel totally comfortable.
Back then, black women were not expected to speak up. However, Rosa Parks was more angry than she seemed. She wrote about her feelings. She wrote how badly she was treated. They had to use black-only bathrooms. "I had been pushed around all my life," Rosa Parks wrote. "I could not take it any more." Rosa Parks wanted people to know her better.
Students are taught military rules. They use "sir" and "ma'am" when talking to adults, for instance. They operate under a rank system and wear uniforms. Students lead units of their peers, do physical training twice a week and follow a demerit system. LA Unified initially had some demands for the program. Students needed to be able to work off disciplinary demerits. The school also had to be open to all students who wanted to attend. North Valley agreed.
Wood said none of the homeowners were warned that a huge mudslide was possible. But he said the government couldn't prevent it. "If the hillsides were going to (slide) away, they were going to (slide) away," Wood said. "That's kind of what happens around here." A 1949 report looked at the reasons mudslides happen in this area. It found that a main cause of the slides is the river slowly washing away a piece of an older slide, called a "toe." The "toe" holds up millions of tons of dirt behind it. It's like someone with their back against a bulging door.
Six players were cut by their teams. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell defended the treatment of Rice. He pointed out that Rice has apologized. In addition, Rice had never been in trouble before. Three U.S. Senators sent a letter to Goodell. In it, they criticized the league for doing too little to punish Rice. The decision to pull Rice for only two games sends an "inescapable message," the letter said: The NFL is not treating the problem with the "seriousness" it deserves.
Some Indians have said she's "anti-Indian" for speaking out against fry bread, she said. Still, the decolonized diet is spreading nationwide. Seeds from hundreds of years ago are being planted. Such seeds are known as heritage seeds. The Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community is helping to lead the return to healthy food. Their large garden is located in Prior Lake, Minnesota. A number of plants in their garden come from heritage seeds. The seeds are also given to other Indian communities.
Russia says its actions in Ukraine were necessary. It claims it had to act to protect Ukrainians with a Russian background. Russian-speaking Ukrainians, it said, were being mistreated. Many are not convinced by that claim. Recently, a top Russian official made the same claims about the Baltic states. He said people of Russian background are being mistreated in those countries too. The Baltic states have been alarmed by such talk. There is now growing fear that Russia may make some move.
The fight over the changes has even led to a government shutdown. But people here in Pennsylvania's Amish country don't worry much about all that. The reason is very simple. Under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, most Americans have to buy some kind of health insurance. But the Amish don't have to if they don't want to. And they have decided not to. It's not that the Amish don't like health insurance. It's just that they insure themselves.
He said that people in Easton have been very interested in the dig. They have also been friendly to the archaeologists. Jenkins enjoys this as it doesn't often happen in archaeology. He said that he sometimes has to dig in lonely places in the countryside. But The Hill is in the middle of town. So the researchers and local people are getting to know each other. Jenkins is excited about working on the project. He wants to write a paper that he says really matters, and not something that just "sits on the shelf."
Jonathan Lovitz is also a supporter of gay rights " he is a gay-rights activist. Tech companies have always been open to new ideas, he says. In fact, that is what their success depends on. They have to be able to think about technology in new ways. Tech companies have long treated gay people well, Lovitz says. Other businesses are only now catching up. These include banks and law firms. Many gay workers feel at home in tech companies.
They are made of simple materials. One video showed a dazed man digging through the rubble. He tried to collect a few modest possessions from his destroyed home. The epicenter of the earthquake was 40 miles northeast of Awaran. The epicenter is on the earth's surface. It is directly above the center of the earthquake. This earthquake had a magnitude of 7.7. The magnitude shows how strong the earthquake is on a 1-10 scale.
Sunnis and Shiites are the two largest Muslim groups in Iraq. They are Arabs, but they practice two different types of Islam. Most Iraqis are Shiites and the government is run by Shiites. Sunni groups are fighting to change this. Some are unhappy that Shiites are now in charge. The Kurds are not Arab and have mostly avoided the conflict. Their own region has some freedom from the Iraqi government. Many Arab Iraqis have fled to the Kurdish region for safety.
They doubt that a lot of drivers or airline passengers will be attracted to the bullet train.  The California bullet train authority said Musk's plan is worth considering. But authority Chairman Dan Richard also said Musk would have things to worry about if he went forward. He would have to protect environmental areas and animals. He would have to avoid hurting businesses and communities. People are already critical of the plan. They say the design is unusual.
People with Ebola can bleed inside their bodies. Some people are scared that two people with Ebola were coming to the United States for medical care. They worry that the disease could begin to spread here. However, Dr. Anthony Fauci insisted that this was highly unlikely. Dr. Fauci talked about the strength of the U.S. health care system. He said that doctors here could keep infected patients away from other people. Still, some people near Emory University Hospital said they were worried. They did not like the idea of Ebola patients being treated in their hometown.
PITTSBURGH " The Copenhagen Zoo in Denmark decided recently to put down an 18-month-old giraffe. Workers at the Danish zoo said they had no choice but to kill the giraffe. The reason why is complicated. They said its genes were too much like the genes of other giraffes. They play a big part in what animals and plants look and act like. Genes are passed down from parents. They determine eye color, hair color, athletic ability, health and more.

They spend a lot of time on smart phones and tablets. The Pew Research Center is a group that surveys people about big things happening in the U.S. Its 2011 survey found that people under 40 were just as likely to give money digitally as over the phone or through the mail. Millennials gave money during the Haiti earthquake of 2010. And they gave big again during the Japanese tsunami disaster of 2011. Famous people such as will.i.am, Sean Penn and Shakira asked people to give money. Three-quarters of the people who gave to help Haiti were younger than 50. Feldmann says that Haiti got aid because of the coverage on TV and the Internet. It showed just how bad the disaster was.
As ocean water warms, so do the glaciers. The warmer water has several causes. One of them is global warming. Global warming happens when people burn fossil fuels. These fuels heat up the Earth.

"It shows what's possible when we work together." The plan could lead to big improvements. Together, the U.S. and China are responsible for more than one-third of the world's greenhouse gases. Scientists say cuts in greenhouse gases could help stop temperatures from rising throughout the world. He studies the relationship between China and the United States. Lieberthal said the new plan is very promising. By 2050, there could be a lot less pollution, he said. Of course, change may not be easy.
The infections could be moving to other places because of climate change, Cope said. N. fowleri thrives in warmer temperatures. Cope says we do not know a lot about the amoeba. We do not know why it chooses its victims. These defenses are called the immune system. But the amoeba has been able to slip past the immune system. There also are not a lot of ways to treat the infections. One reason is the illness moves quickly.
The company has about 7,600 stores nationwide. It is the second largest drugstore company in the country. Only Walgreen Co. is larger. Larry Merlo is the president of CVS.

If it came up with another name, that name could be protected. The Redskins aren't ready to give up yet, though. The team quickly announced it will fight the new ruling. It may be years before a final decision is made. This was actually the second time the board has ruled on the team's name. In 1999, it ruled almost the same way it has now. That earlier ruling was reversed in 2003. In 2003 the courts had reversed the decision because those who objected to the name had waited too long to complain.
Like the group at camp, they made around nine mistakes five days later. For the video test, the students' scores stayed the same. The control group got almost three out of 10 of the feelings correct both times. The researchers think the key is the change the kids showed over time. Still, the group at camp showed more improvement over the five days. Uhls and Greenfield said it is important for kids to spend time away from screens. The study does not mean that all screen time is bad. People should understand it is important that kids have time for face-to-face socializing.

"A lot of the students call me ‘dad' or ‘uncle,'" he said. "I am often the positive male role model. They need someone who can say, ‘Don't do that' " someone who is not afraid of them." The organizers of the Black Men Teaching Initiative hope that providing African-American middle and high school students with mentors will create a snowball effect. When those students grow up, they can become mentors as well. Education experts support this effort for more diversity. They warn, though, that more black male teachers is not the only solution. They say poor schools and under-trained teachers can also hurt black students.
The jury decided in favor of Abbott. The other drug company asked for a new trial. The other company, GlaxoSmithKline, claimed that Abbott didn't want the man on the jury because he was gay. Abbott gave several reasons for excluding the man. "Jury service is one of the most important responsibilities of an American citizen," Reinhardt wrote. It gives gay people a way of expressing what's important to them. It also gives them a say in issues that affect their lives. No one has to say if they're gay.
He bought his Kindle four years ago. At the time, he said, there was "practically nothing available to download in Spanish." Alcaraz said that things are very different now. He can easily find many interesting electronic titles in Spanish. And also the science fiction stories he likes to read during airplane flights. "There's just been an incredible change," said Alcaraz. His experience is not unusual. Latinos are buying tablet computers and e-readers far faster than the U.S. population as a whole.
Aziz has young daughters. "We only shower two times a week," he said. There are many reasons why this is happening. Iran has gone for a  long time without rain.

The black-and-white lizards are popular as pets. The ones found in Florida were probably given up by their owners. Scientists need to catch as many tegus as they can before October. Tegus go into hibernation then. Then, they sleep for three or four months. It will be hard to find them once they're sleeping. Scientists are worried that tegus will spread to Everglades National Park. Some already have been caught there.
So where is the positive charge coming from? Some scientists suggested the jets might contain positrons as well as electrons. Positrons are positively charged and are the opposite of electrons. Unlike electrons, they are not found in normal matter. They can also exist on their own, as can electrons. But other scientists were not convinced: They thought the jets were made of much heavier normal matter. Until now, it wasn't clear what was causing the positive charge, said scientist James Miller-Jones. Was it positrons?
People are bitterly divided by their religious beliefs. Sunnis and Shiites are the two largest Muslim groups in Iraq. They are Arabs, but they practice two different types of Islam. Most Iraqis are Shiites and the government is run by Shiites. They once ran the country. Some are unhappy that Shiites are now in charge. The Kurds are not Arab and have mostly avoided the conflict. Their own region has some freedom from the Iraqi government.
The Canadian government said the new rules make it harder to sell things in the United States. It worries that it will sell less beef here.

Waves from the Pacific Ocean washed over what is now Wilshire Boulevard. The city won't begin building new subway lines until next year.
That heat is believed to have changed the movement of the jet stream to the south. A jet stream is a fast-moving river of air high up in the sky. Scientists think that the jet stream's move south might be causing some serious weather changes. The shift might be slowing down storms. That movement can mean serious problems for coastal areas. Kevin Wood is also a scientist at the University of Washington. He road on the Hurricane Hunter too. Wood said that floods and snowstorms might be due to Arctic heat as well.
She stunned everyone by being the best at pushing bobsleds on dry land. Three months later, Evans was about to ride the bobsled for the first time. She was going to sit in the back of a 375-pound sled for about 50 seconds. The sled goes faster than 70 mph. Bonny Warner was in the Olympics three times on another kind of sled. One time she described what happens when a bobsled goes by. "The ground shakes," she said. She said steering it was like trying to drive an overloaded truck.

Americans are not allowed to do business with Cuba. That makes visiting Cuba really hard. Americans may travel to Cuba. But the rules don't make it easy. The rules are less strict for Cuban-Americans. Roughly 400,000 Cuban-Americans went to Cuba last year. President Barack Obama changed a rule in 2009. Unlimited visits to family members are now allowed.
But that is only a small part of the problem. Crabs eat barnacles. And crabs in turn are eaten by other animals. This means that the plastic that barnacles eat is spreading through the food web. Fish that swallow plastic debris cause damage to their livers. And not only the plastic itself is dangerous. The poisonous chemicals the plastic has absorbed are dangerous as well. Other scientists look at the problem from another angle.
And that has to start with us." But elected officials may not be able to boycott. New Jersey's law does not allow preferences when a town puts out a bid to get equipment or services, said Bill Dressel. For example, if a town wants to buy a fire truck, it puts out a bid. The town picks the lowest bidder. "Local governments must follow state law," said Dressel. He is the executive director of the New Jersey association of cities. Dressel said state lawmakers could change the law.

That would also decrease the amount of water used in the home, she said. "If it's yellow, let it mellow," she recommends. Only solid waste needs to be flushed right away, she says. Experts say the next greatest water saver is a better clothes washer. Those models use about 34 gallons per load. But, a washer that opens from the front will use less than 15 gallons. The survey asked people what one thing people could do to save the most water. Almost half got it wrong.
So the experts had to decide if it counted. The building is 1,776 feet high with the spire. The spire makes it taller than the Willis Tower which is 1,451 feet tall. The height also means something special. The new World Trade Center is 1,776 feet tall. It takes the place of the twin towers. They were part of the old World Trade Center.

"Afghanistan has been at war for 30 years," Rostiyar says. "People spend this much money to get a break from all the misery." Afghanistan got rid of its last king in 1973. Since then, control of the country has changed often. Young people getting married have never experienced peace time in their own country. Abdullah Rahman got engaged a year ago. The father of the woman he was going to marry set the walwar price at $15,000. Rahman and his family bargained him down to $10,000.
Other issues fell away in a final deal. The struggle has occupied essentially all of Congress' time for the past three weeks. The shutdown began on Oct. 1. It came after Cruz and his tea party allies in the House demanded money be pulled from the health care law. Obama and Reid refused. Then they refused again and again as Boehner gradually scaled back Republican demands. Initially, about 800,000 government workers were sent home. That soon fell to about 350,000 after Congress agreed to let Pentagon employees return to work.
They will fly to Romania. The Eastern European country is where the upcoming Black Sea International ROV Competition will take place. An ROV is a remotely operated vehicle, like the robot they have built. The contest is the largest one for underwater robotics in Europe. They will see whose robot can rescue a fake diver underwater. The robot also has to turn off an underwater bomb. The top three teams will be taken out to a real shipwreck. There, the robots must find and bring back hidden treasure.
The leagues knew about the injuries. They did not protect the players, he said. He added that rules still have not been changed to prevent fighting. The lawsuit says the NHL hid the risks of concussions from the players. It is caused by a blow to the head. The lawsuit said that because of the NHL's actions, players were at a much higher risk for developing health problems. These include memory loss and trouble thinking. Players even could have brain-related diseases because of the league's actions, the lawsuit said.
The government promised it will be clean in time for the 2016 Olympic Games. The bay and other Rio waterways will hold Olympic sailing events. But some people say the boats don't do enough. They don't deal with waste water that's flushed out of homes and into the bay. There isn't much in the way of trash and sewage services in Rio. This is a huge city of 6 million people. Tons of garbage and raw waste flow down its rivers each day. They empty into the bay.
The American Museum of Natural History has many animals. It has big tigers. Now the museum has a new animal. His name is Lonesome George. Lonesome George is a tortoise. A tortoise looks like a very big turtle.
The warmer water has several causes. One of them is global warming. Global warming happens when people burn fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are fuels from the Earth, like coal, oil and gas.

 A Washington state oyster-farming family built a large shellfish hatchery here. They are half an ocean away from Seattle. The hatchery is on a green patch of island below a volcano. Rising acid levels in the ocean off the Pacific Northwest's coast left the Nisbet family no choice.
Then they were checked to make sure they had not developed Ebola. The United States and other countries gave thermometers to Nigeria. The thermometers took the temperatures of people coming into the country. Ebola can be spread only when people develop certain signs. Two Nigerian billionaires donated more than $1 million. Oil and cellphone companies also gave money. And maybe Nigeria was lucky. Nobody on the airplane with Sawyer got Ebola.
DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK, Calif. " The cracking sounds were loud. Under sunny skies, an ankle-deep, frozen lake was breaking apart. The shallow lake here in Death Valley National Park is normally dry. It is known as "the Racetrack Playa." Death Valley is the hottest, driest place on Earth. On Dec. 21 of last year, though, the playa was anything but dry. Cousins Richard Norris and James Norris were observing the scene. Both are scientists.
It is changing everything from coaching to player fitness to how fans watch the game. Ben Alamar works for an NBA team. He is excited about data in basketball.

All sports are using data to make better decisions, said Brian Kopp. He works for a sports data company.
"They've been really worthwhile because I'm learning things I don't learn in school, and that I don't think they even teach in the university here," he said. "For instance, we don't learn artificial intelligence here. We don't have labs for it." The study of artificial intelligence deals with things like robots. Roosemberth is an example of one of the best things about MOOCs: They can help find bright students in poorer countries. Such students might otherwise remained undiscovered. And they might never get the chance to use their talents. Thousands of students from Latin America are taking these online classes.
It killed 161 people. Tornadoes are rated on the Fujita scale from 1-5. An F1 is the weakest. Joplin's 2011 tornado was an F5. Whenever there is a tornado, people become interested in Erwin's company. He got six calls from schools and businesses just on Tuesday. "Unfortunately, it takes events like these to remind us that we have to protect ourselves," he said. Hurricane Katrina in 2005 was one such reminder.
Paleontologists can't watch them in the wild. So they'll "probably never know" whether T. rex preferred scavenging or hunting, Holtz said. The new fossil helps give a tiny snapshot, though. "Sometimes it's the little bones that count," he said. And rex means king in Latin. So it seems T. rex actually did live up to its name so many millions of years ago.
Some want sharks to be named an endangered species. That means they are about to be wiped out. They counted only 219 great white sharks. Other scientists counted sharks near San Francisco. Michael L. Domeier is a shark expert. He thinks the shark count is much too low. He has studied sharks for a long time. Other scientists are doing another count.
They also had the freedom to say what they wanted. East Germany was communist. The government there controlled and owned almost everything. East Germans didn't have much freedom during this time. Klaus-Jurgen Warnick was one of those East Germans. He remembers November 1989, when crowds of East Germans came to the wall, demanding to be let through. The East German guards let them go. The Berlin Wall fell as people broke through it with hammers.
But another 50 feet of line remained wrapped around the whale's tail. The animal dragged several buoys behind it. The waves grew to 10 feet high. The boats were getting tossed around. The crew turned back. The whale swam south for several days. On May 1, it strayed far offshore. Seven days later, rescuers drove south.
And it killed up to 200 million people. Did the same type of bacteria cause both diseases? A team of scientists from around the world set out to answer that question. They took DNA from the teeth of two plague victims. The plague victims were buried in Germany around the time of the Justinian Plague outbreak. The scientists first rebuilt the germ that killed both victims. Then they compared it with other types of bacteria from the same family. These bacteria are found worldwide in animals and humans.
Police searched Riley's phone without a warrant. In other words, they looked through the phone without getting permission from a judge. Riley's case will address an important question: Should warrant-less searches of cellphones be allowed? The Supreme Court must decide if smartphones are covered by the Fourth Amendment. The Fourth Amendment provides protection against unreasonable searches. The Court's decisions will update rules made long ago. Those rules were written years before smartphones existed. A modern smartphone, lawyer Jeffrey L. Fisher noted, contains a lot of information about us.
The Canary Islands have a snake problem. The problem is there are a lot of them. They are taking over. The islands lie off the coast of northwestern Africa. The snakes are from North America and are called California kingsnakes. The local animals have had no time to learn how to avoid the snakes. Doing this would take a very long time.
What should be done about unhealthy packed lunches? It may not be easy to change what kind of food parents pack for their kids. The government was able to change cafeteria food by passing new rules. Changing packed lunches might be more challenging. Not much is known about the nutritional value of packed lunches. Studies like this one can help educate parents about their food choices.
The scientists, Emmanuel Virot and Alexandre Ponomarenko, believe that popcorn is a special food. So, they studied the snack very closely to learn more. Scientists who study food have done experiments on popcorn in the past. These scientists studied how to make better popcorn. They wanted to figure out why popcorn acts and tastes like it does. Popcorn has a scientific name: Zea mays everta. It is the only type of corn that actually pops. Popcorn kernels are rounder than other corn.
Gaza is surrounded by a fence and borders both Israel and Egypt. Israel controls the fence on its border. Egypt controls the fence on its border. The people of Gaza have a hard time leaving or doing business. Hamas wants it lifted. Israel currently has no plans to lift the blockade. Removing the blockade would reward Hamas, Israel says. Israel holds Hamas responsible for violence leading up to the war.
These inspections had shown that the bridge was in "satisfactory" condition. So engineers were not worried about this particular crossing. Yet this bridge is nearly 60 years old. Back then, bridges were built in such a way that  if one part of the bridge was damaged the whole structure could fall down. There are 362 similar bridges in Washington State. Expert Jugesh Kapur said that a truck whacking into a bridge could cause it to collapse. Guardrails are usually put up to stop vehicles hitting important parts of the bridge. "Generally, there's a traffic barrier to protect the bridge.
The Peace Prize is one of the most famous awards in the world. Giving the prize to the OPCW does two things: First, it will make people pay attention to the bloody civil war in Syria. Second, it makes more people aware of poison gases. The weapons have been used for nearly a century. Opinions about the prize varied in Syria. A Syrian rebel said the award will move the world's attention away from "the real cause of the war." The rebels are fighting the government. On the other side, a lawmaker from Syria's government said it would help the Syrian President Bashar Assad.
Miller has said hateful things against Jews and others. Police do not think that Miller knew his three victims. Obama asked the religious leaders to fight religious hate, including anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism is prejudice against Jews. Obama said prejudice "can lead to hatred and to violence." Obama said that during Easter we sense "that there's a lot of pain and a lot of sin and a lot of tragedy in this world," he said. But we're also more aware of God, he said. Obama added, "We're all children of God, we're all made in his image, all worthy of his love and dignity."
It has become one of Asia's weakest currencies. Another big problem is that the nation's foreign reserves are shrinking. Foreign reserves are the amount of foreign currency in the country's banks. Indians use foreign currencies to pay for imports " that is, things they buy from other countries. India's foreign reserves have fallen to $280 billion. This is dangerously low. It is only enough to buy seven months worth of imports. Recently, the Indian government began raising taxes on some imports.
A pattern began: he would be arrested, charged with a crime, sent to jail. He sold drugs in 32 states and was put behind bars many times. For the last 22 years of his life, Briscoe has been either in prison or on probation. After being released from prison he was put on probation. He had to report what he did every day and deal with surprise visits by his probation officer. In prison, though, one unlikely thing changed Briscoe's life and put him on the right path: reading. Briscoe's change came after he saw another prisoner trying to read a children's book to his son. The prisoner struggled to read.
BETHESDA, Md. " That something is statistical analysis. Statistics is a type of math. It involves looking at information, often in the form of numbers, and finding out what the information means. It has become popular to use for advertisements, for computers and now for sports.
YUBA CITY, Calif. " Here in California's Central Valley, birds flying high in the sky have spotted water. They are coming in for a landing. Migrating birds " birds heading south for the winter " need wetlands. These areas are places for birds to rest and eat during their long journeys. These wetlands are man-made. They are flooded rice fields. Birds need spots like this these days. The drought in California has dried out many natural wetlands in the state.
Sometimes they simply measure golfers tapping the ball a few inches toward the hole. For most events, about 350 volunteers are needed. Now, some players have begun relying on a person close to them to look at that information. The information is mostly in numbers. Players who use experts to track them include Jason Day, Zach Johnson and Brandt Snedeker Colin Swatton is Jason Day's coach. He has been helping Day use statistics to help his golf swing since 2007. Swatton doesn't rely on ShotLink because as hardworking as the volunteers are, he said they do make mistakes.
They are related to turtles. Unlike turtles, tortoises don't usually swim. People are trying to protect the rare turtles and tortoises. They are marking the rarest turtles on Earth. Paul Gibbons gently placed a turtle on a table. He picked up a tool. Then he carved a code into the tortoise's shell. The letters and numbers are 2 inches high and read "7001 MG." They can never be erased.
But things got a lot worse for teens when businesses got hit bad in 2008. Older workers took more of the jobs that teens used to hold. So people who want to get jobs in their 20s won't have any work experience, said Keith Hall. He worked for the U.S. government from 2008 to 2012. One problem is that business has not grown much since the Great Recession of 2008. That means older workers aren't moving up. So younger workers won't move up as fast as they used to, either, Hall said.
"I haven't done nothing that the next kid growing up hadn't done." He couldn't believe his name was on the list. Chicago police are trying to figure out who is most likely to shoot someone. Or to be shot themselves. Then, they use math to sort that information. Police officials said they had come up with a list of 420 names. They had looked at various questions, such as: How many times has a person been arrested? Have they been arrested for carrying weapons?
It would know about every activist in the civil rights struggle across the country. That is the difference that technology makes and it's important that we don't let our government get away with it. Our spy state is also making the U.S. into a country run by companies and the military. They're becoming more powerful compared to our elected leaders, including the president. They're currently blocking attempts to cut down the NSA's bad actions. It's not just your private life that is being invaded. Our entire democracy is being attacked.
Before 2010, more than half of the cases came from Southern states. Since then, infections have turned up as far north as Minnesota. "We're seeing it in states where we hadn't seen cases before," says Jennifer Cope. She is an expert in amoeba infections at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The infections could be moving to other places because of climate change, Cope said. N. fowleri thrives in warmer temperatures. Cope says we do not know a lot about the amoeba. We do not know why it chooses its victims.
MINNEAPOLIS " Doctors are using simulators that let them practice surgeries. They do practice surgeries on body parts. But the body parts aren't real. They're made with fake parts. The practice surgeries show up in 3-D on a screen so the doctors can see what they're doing.
The police wore military style clothing called camouflage. They stood in armored vehicles and pointed powerful rifles at the protesters. The police response has raised a question: Are police departments getting too much military-style equipment from the U.S. government? Ferguson is a small city near St. Louis. They say the police appear too much like soldiers. There was a huge jump in violence in the 1970s and 1980s. Then the country got tough on crime. Things have improved over 20 years in most places.
This is important because sea temperatures are rising. But reefs can only take a little warming. So we have to keep water temperatures from getting too high. There is one good way to do this: burning less fuels. Heating a house burns fuel. Running a factory burns fuel. All these things put carbon dioxide in the air. This is making temperatures rise slowly.
So blue LEDs could be used to make clean drinking water, Delsing said. He said the invention benefits all humans. Akasaki and Amano worked together at a university in Japan to make the discovery. Nakamura worked at a chemicals company in Japan. Nakamura is now a professor at the University of California. He learned of his award in the middle of the night. "It's unbelievable," Nakamura said. "It's amazing.
It will provide fresh drinking water in the middle of California's drought. The new building is known as the Carlsbad Desalination Project. It will be used for desalination " that means de-salting. Machinery will remove salt from Pacific Ocean water. Each day, 56 million gallons of seawater will be desalinated. It will be turned into drinking water for San Diego County. Right now, the county needs drinkable water badly. It has to rely on water shipped in from elsewhere.
Her wavy black hair peeks out from under a head scarf. Koofi demands the respect of her male coworkers. She treasures her "love marriage" with the husband she chose for herself. Most Afghan marriages are arranged by families, like her parents' marriage. Koofi's husband calls her "a very brave woman." He helps with housework and caring for their baby son. Some of his male friends think men shouldn't help out around the house. They see it as weak and shameful.
It will be able to improve treatment. It will also allow scientists to learn more about the longer-term effects of concussion. Earlier studies have shown that concussions can cause serious problems. Children with concussions can have trouble learning. This has made parents uncomfortable about allowing their children to play several sports. President Barack Obama understands that concern. If he had a son, he said in 2013, he would not let him play pro football. Still, the Obamas take a strong interest in sports.
It thinks the underwater boat, or submarine, is foreign. It says it entered Swedish waters without permission. The search is making countries around the Baltic Sea very nervous. Sweden's search is bringing back bad memories of the Cold War. It wasn't a regular war. Instead, it was a standoff. On one side were U.S.-led Western countries; on the other side were the Soviet Bloc countries led by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union, in turn, was controlled by Russia.
Protesters were met by police officers. The police wore military style clothing called camouflage. They stood in armored vehicles and pointed powerful rifles at the protesters. The police response has raised a question: Are police departments getting too much military-style equipment from the U.S. government? Politicians who are usually on different sides are on the same side of the Ferguson argument. They say the police appear too much like soldiers. There was a huge jump in violence in the 1970s and 1980s. Then the country got tough on crime.
They have three children " Prince Felipe and Princesses Elena and Cristina. The press was grateful for the democratic freedoms. They felt the king was partly responsible. So, at first they protected the royal family. But recently the press stopped protecting the king. In 2012, news about an expensive hunting expedition to Africa appeared in Spain's newspapers. The elephant hunting trip took place in the middle of an economic crisis. Nearly a quarter of  Spanish workers lost their jobs.
Obama didn't mention any of the other non-African countries. China, however, has been criticized for its behavior. It doesn't develop businesses in Africa, some say. Instead, it simply buys up raw materials like oil and minerals. African countries end up making less money than they might otherwise. What's more, they learn nothing about processing materials themselves. In addition, Chinese companies in Africa rarely hire African workers. The only jobs Africans get are the lowest-level ones.
The 8-year-old boy lives in Illinois. Many kids go crazy over a really popular toy. But people are surprised that boys love the Rainbow Loom as much as girls do. The Rainbow Loom helps kids make colorful rubber band bracelets. He is from Michigan. His two daughters liked making rubber band bracelets. But Ng couldn't join in. His fingers were too big to make make the tiny knots.
She runs a nonprofit called New Spirit. It works to keep nonreligious young people living in Jerusalem by helping them get jobs and pay for houses. For years, many nonreligious young people have been leaving the city. Housing prices are high and jobs are scarce. There is a lot of anger against the ultra-Orthodox throughout Israel. More than half of all ultra-Orthodox men study at religious schools. They do not work. Few of them serve in the army.
ST. PETERSBURG, Russia " U.S. President Barack Obama said Wednesday that the world needs to punish Bashar Assad. The Syrian president supposedly ordered a poison gas attack on his people. Obama said if Assad is not punished, other leaders will not take future warnings seriously. The Middle Eastern country of Syria is fighting a civil war. Thousands of people have been killed. Many of those killed were not part of the war. Obama said a year ago that Assad would be crossing a "red line" if he used poison gas. He did not make up the red line, Obama said Wednesday.
Obama's daughters, Malia and Natasha, are 15 and 13. Obama said the U.S. has tried in the past to work with Nigeria to stop Boko Haram. Boko Haram is an Islamist extremist group. It is against anything that comes from Western countries. The group believes girls shouldn't go to school at all. Obama called Boko Haram one of the worst local terrorist groups. He said they kill people without mercy. The Nigeria government has been unable to rescue the girls.
The crowd stood up and clapped. McCarthy visited the Bristol Bay area this week. Her visit took place as people across the country discuss the project. It could be the largest open-pit mine in North America. It's in a region that is home to half the world's wild red salmon. Supporters of the mine project say it will create new jobs. Those against the mine say it will destroy streams, wetlands and salmon. Many Dillingham residents are against the mine.
ATLANTA " Major League Soccer's newest team will be in Atlanta. The team will begin play in 2017. Arthur Blank is the team's owner. Blank looked down at his red, black and gold scarf. "I love this one," he said. "I haven't taken it off since it was given to me. I may not sleep in it tonight, but I may.
She said this about the NSA gathering information about leaders of countries that work with the U.S.: "I am totally opposed." Two Spanish newspapers reported on a document leaked by Snowden. They said it showed that the NSA collected information on 60 million telephone calls. The calls were made in Spain between December 2012 and early January. Spanish officials called the U.S. Ambassador in to discuss the matter. The Ambassador lives in Spain and represents the U.S. After the meeting, he made a statement. He said that the United States needs to balance privacy and security.
He is the head of the Producers Group, a theme park design and construction company. Marks has worked on many projects in Asia. Theme park designers also have to respect local beliefs. One of them is feng shui, Marks said. Many Chinese believe that buildings must face a certain direction for good luck and to keep away evil spirits. Marks said his company has had to turn around buildings and move rides to improve their feng shui. Marks and others in California's theme park industry are happy to learn those rules. China is spending billions on theme parks.
He colors the wax with dye, then removes it with an iron. He repeats each step over and over. Other ideas fill Twiggs' work as well. In some pieces, the Confederate flag is made to look like a railroad-crossing sign. They sometimes separate black and white neighborhoods. For many, the Confederate flag is a reminder of when whites kept blacks as slaves. Twiggs, however, takes that flag and changes it. It becomes part of his experience.
They held up signs, marched and shouted. They felt Brown's death was not right. To keep the protests calm, police departments sent officers. The police had armored cars, large guns and body armor. Their weapons made some people more upset. Now, President Barack Obama is ordering new rules. He wants to help fix the relationship between police forces and the communities they protect. Some people do not trust the police.
Brad Erwin was in junior high school. Much  of his hometown was destroyed, including two schools. The tornado killed 29 people. But more could have died if it struck a day later, Erwin believes. Classrooms would have been filled with children. Now he spends all his time trying to stop such a disaster. Erwin is an architect. His job is to design plans for buildings.
It is set by Congress. The government says that the limit will be reached around Oct. 17. After that, the government may be unable to pay its bills. Congress gets to make laws. But later it says the government can't borrow the money. Sounds like a strange system, right? Well, the Founding Fathers made it that way. The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to make laws.
New Haven Promise is no one-way street. The students have to sign a pledge to "do their best." They must live in New Haven and attend New Haven public schools. They must get high grades and have excellent attendance. They also have to give several hours of their time to a community group. But it turns out that providing free tuition is not always enough. Many students do not have enough support at home. They need someone to set a good example for them.
Silicon Valley is the center of the technology industry. One-quarter of the people who live there are Hispanic. So the fact that there are few Latinos trying to start tech companies does not seem to make sense. Avila decided to start another business because of what he saw. Just as an incubator on a farm keeps eggs warm until they are ready to hatch, Avila's business helps new Latino businesses get up and running. The incubator is ready to debut. The first seven startups begin "class" this week. But the incubator already has some big name supporters.
There are 156 million people in Bangladesh. That is almost half as many as in the United States. And all of them live in an area about the size of Iowa. Growing enough food for all of those people is a challenge. This is why farmers in Bangladesh have started using vertical gardens. They hope that vertical gardens can help grow enough food. Farmers can grow vegetables without taking up much space. Vertical gardens were brought to Bangladesh by WorldFish.
Imagine 100 mothers having a baby in a rich country like the United States, and 100 mothers having a baby in a very poor country like Angola, in Africa. In the United States, only one of those babies would die before they are 5 years old. In Angola, 17 would die. One out of 100 is a low rate of child death. Around the world, the rate of young children dying has been cut in half since 1990. The United Nations was hoping for more progress by 2015. Things are getting better in many countries. Even the poorest countries are making progress, said Dr. Mickey Chopra of the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF).
Capitol was the fifth-largest, but it moved up to second place after Barnett took over. Barnett made big changes at Capitol Records. He picked different artists. He signed two of the biggest acts of last year, Sam Smith and 5 Seconds of Summer. Then the companies sell and promote the records. The 2015 Grammy awards were good to Capitol Records' artists. Their musicians got 46 nominations. Smith got six nominations for his first album and was nominated in the top four awards: best record, album, song and new artist.
AMSTERDAM - During World War II, the Germans stole works of art from their Jewish owners. Even after Germany lost the war, the artworks were still missing. A large investigation has just finished in the Netherlands. It looked at art hanging in Dutch museums. The goal was to find out if any of the art was once stolen by the German Nazis. There are 139 works that may have been looted, or stolen.
When she was 2 years old, she was hit by a car. She was hurt. She cannot walk. Daniela is now 15. She is in a class for learning English. The kids in class are from many countries. They also had problems. This fall, they wrote their stories.
Kids who ride scooters also get hurt worse. They are more likely to break an arm or leg. They break their bones about three times as often. They also get sent to the hospital more often. For example: Four out of five accidents with toys happen at home. More accidents happen to boys. Accidents from toys were higher in the spring and summer.
One video showed a dazed man digging through the rubble. He tried to collect a few modest possessions from his destroyed home. The epicenter of the earthquake was 40 miles northeast of Awaran. Earthquakes start underground. It is directly above the center of the earthquake. This earthquake had a magnitude of 7.7. The magnitude shows how strong the earthquake is on a 1-10 scale. A magnitude 8 earthquake is 10 times stronger than one measuring magnitude 7.
They learn exactly what they should say and do to stop bullying. Many educators and researchers like the program. They say it reduces bullying. Others worry that giving prizes for being nice sends the wrong message. They also do not believe it works in the long run. As soon as the reward ends, the good behavior also could stop, they say. More than 20 percent of children are involved in bullying. The number of children involved in bullying surprised people.
Instead, they looked for chickens that could live on a hotter planet. The Earth is heating up. This is called [global warming](. warming). Scientists say people burn too much fossil fuels. These include fuel from wood, oil and coal. Many farm animals can't stand the heat. So, food scientists are developing animals that can. Some global warming experts don't like their work.
WASHINGTON – The Federal government will be trying to sell wild horses at an auction this weekend in Texas. It cannot figure out what else to do with them. These animals are part of American history. They  are related to the horses used by Spanish explorers, Native Americans and the cavalry. The government has taken nearly 50,000 wild horses off their lands in the West. It paid ranchers to take care of them. More of America's wild horses are now being held than running wild. The roundups have made wild horse supporters angry.
LONDON " The National Football League (NFL) may soon have a new football team " in London, England. It would play against U.S. teams. A new study looked at what a London team could mean. It found that a new team would be very good for British businesses. It could earn them an extra $252 million a year.
The students got grades of A or B without learning anything or doing any work. An office secretary, Deborah Crowder, would look over the students' research papers and assign grades. She would sign the name of the department chairman, Julius Nyang'oro, to grade lists. Both Crowder and Nyang'oro are now retired. She said the fake classes could have been caught sooner. She explained that two exceptions to the rules helped Crowder and Nyang'oro keep the cheating going for so long. First, the AFAM department was not examined like other academic departments because it did not have a graduate students. It only had undergraduate students.
Scientists are still learning about how dogs and cats drink. Sunghwan Jung is a scientist who studies how animals drink water. Different animals drink water in different ways, he said. Some animals drink water by sucking it up. Humans use suction. We use our cheeks to suck up liquid to drink. Our cheeks act like a vacuum inside our mouths. When we drink water through a straw, we suck it up like a vacuum.
Bugs contain a lot of protein. The Dutch professors came up with another idea: hamburger meat grown in huge tanks. Sounds better than bugs, doesn't it? One day, they say, every town will grow its own meat. Muscle cells would be taken from pigs, cows, chicken, fish or other animals. The cells would grow in 5,200-gallon tanks full of seaweed-like plants. Paddles would keep the whole thing in motion. In a month, chemicals would be added.
Students in Thailand are imitating the "Hunger Games" movies. The army has banned the sign of holding up three fingers. It has arrested young people for using it. Three students were arrested in a movie theater showing "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay " Part 1." The day before, five other students were also arrested for using the three-finger sign.
A 20-year-old woman in Taiwan has become the first person to get sick with a certain bird flu. It's known as H6N1. Bird flu is a type of flu that jumps from birds to humans. But it is scary because a type called H5N1 is very dangerous. It has killed half of all people who got it. Luckily, only 638 people have caught it in the world ever. But, in the past few years there have been outbreaks in Asia, Africa and parts of Europe.
It has space for 100 students. The programs show what a job in health care is really like. Many TV shows, for instance, do not give a real view. They mostly feature doctors. These include repairing medical equipment or taking X-rays. The special programs offer hands-on experiences to students. They can follow health workers who rush to emergencies. They can practice stitching up chicken legs.
The scientists will watch over SeaWorld's orcas. They will see if the orcas are happy. But PETA is unhappy. PETA a group that wants to protect animals. It does not like the new plans for the orcas. It wants the orcas to be put in the ocean. PETA says orcas don't like any pools. They call it a prison.
An operation could be dangerous for a giraffe, said Joerg Jebram. He works for the European zoo association. He oversees its [endangered species](. species) program for giraffes. Zoo workers would have to give the animal medicine to keep it calm. The effect could also cause the animal to fall and break its neck. The European zoo association said it supports Copenhagen Zoo. It said decision to put the giraffe down was the right one. The association said it "believes strongly" in protecting animal gene pools.
More and more these days, the Chinese are looking overseas. They are hoping to find big stretches of farmland to use. On such land, food is already being grown for the Chinese back home. The Chinese have been focusing on many far-off places: the United States, Chile, Brazil, Russia, Ukraine, Bulgaria and Australia. China is getting wealthier very quickly. This has led to a huge demand for food, said Ma. "When we look overseas, we see large tracts of land where you can operate a farm." Chinese interest in overseas farmland makes perfect sense.
Some people don't like the electric fence. They want the canal physically plugged. They say it's necessary to stop the Asian carp. Josh Mogerman works for the Natural Resources Defense Council. He said the problems with the electric fence are serious. And the study proved that the government needs a real fix for the carp problem. He says that a physical barrier, or wall, is the only way to stop the "dangerous critters" from getting into Lake Michigan.
It may have other benefits as well. Maybe fewer students would be absent for class. Some may even do better work in school because they are not so tired. This is why some doctors think that starting school later is a good idea. Will parents be able to get their kids ready for school before going to work? Starting school later may be difficult. Even so, the American Academy of Pediatrics says that schools should try it. Getting enough sleep, they say, is important for teenagers' health.
Mostafavi called on religious leaders, reporters, and police to help end the practice. She said it breaks both Afghan and religious law. Recently, about 400 religious leaders came to Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan,  to oppose walwar. They agreed to argue against the tradition at their mosques. Walwar is not the only thing that keeps couples from getting married in Afghanistan. The average worker makes $35 a month. But Afghans spend tens of thousands of dollars on a wedding. They often invite hundreds of guests.
Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., lead the Senators who were against the bill. He warned that it will not "end the lawlessness in the future." Other Republicans had a different view. They mostly come from states with a large or growing number of Hispanic people. Last year, their presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, won only about one-fourth of the Hispanic vote. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz, said if someone is going to stay in the United States for "20 or 30 or 40 or 50 years" they should take on American ways. "I want them to have the rights, and more importantly, the responsibilities that come with citizenship," Flake said.
I was sick to my stomach," said resort president Paul Caldwell. He got the call from his staff at about 10:30 p.m. They told him the 15-year-old buildings full of guests were sinking into the ground. Sinkholes are common in land where the rock below the surface can be dissolved by water flowing through it, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Florida, Texas, Alabama, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee and Pennsylvania get a lot of damage from sinkholes. A guest ran into the street to alert resort workers after the windows began to shatter, Caldwell said. Firefighters arriving on scene immediately went door-to-door of building 104 to help guests escape. The three-story building was sliced nearly in half.
A lifeguard said on the worst days he has 100 men arrive by 3 a.m. They clear the water and the shore using boats, nets and trucks. "On a heavy day, we can load up 15 trucks," he said. "Sometimes we get 150 or even 160 tons in a day." It grows wild in summer when days are longer and the sun is high in the sky. High levels of chemicals in the water can kickstart the growth. Tim Nelson is a seaweed expert at Seattle Pacific University. He said those chemicals might get stirred up from deeper in the ocean.
Each team can have one player who is not blind. They must wear dark glasses too. "For sure, the first time you play it's scary," Adams said. Goalball is a rough game. The best goalball players throw the ball up to 50 miles per hour. Players wear pads to protect their knees, hips and elbows. They don't wear face masks. They learn to guard their faces with their arms.
This season, two games were played at London's famous Wembley Stadium. The third and final game at Wembley will be next Sunday. The London games have been very successful. The teams travel from the United States for their games. Wouldn't it make sense for London to have its own team? A London team would mean more football games there. It would also bring in money for London businesses. Suppose the team played eight home games a season.
After those two meetings, Obama began thinking more about the problems of African-American boys. He decided he had to do something to help. The result is My Brother's Keeper. Its goal is to make the best use of money the government already has. At least $200 million has already been pledged by charities. It will be directed at education and finding young men jobs, among other things. The new push may not solve the big problems of race. But the president has seen personal results already.
Also, this still holds true even if you stay in school longer or you come from a richer family. Hold it right there, say a bunch of American educators. They agree that early learning is important for job success. It creates kindergarten-ready kids. But family wealth also matters. For starters, only about half of American children attend good pre-kindergarten programs, said Libby Doggett. She works for the U.S. Department of Education. In preschool, kids learn tools for reading and math.
Up to 5 million deaths each year may be linked to too much sitting. So how much couch potato time is OK? That's the big question, Semanik said. "We don't know how much is OK." But movement breaks does reduce the harm caused by too much sitting. The researchers say people just need to to get up and move. It doesn't matter what they do once they're up. Getting older adults off the couch may be easier than getting them to exercise. This is especially true for people who already have health problems, like heart disease.
Each was made up of 30 to 40 animals. As the climate became warmer, forests formed. That left less food for the mammoths. AMLI Residential owns the property where the tusk was found. AMLI got "a little nervous" when told about the discovery. After all, it meant they might have to stop work on apartments the company is building there. But then the company "realized the benefits far outweighed the cost." Even if it means some construction delay.
ALEPPO, Syria " Entering the prayer room of an ancient mosque, a teenager named Hussein Mansour plopped himself down. He placed a grenade and a small bag of pretzels on the table. Hussein and the others in the room are rebels: that means they are fighting against the Syrian government. Hussein picked up the grenade again. Then, he pretended to pull the ring. Another rebel fighter, Abu Musab, looked over at the 16-year-old. "I mean, he's carrying a grenade and a 3-cent bag of chips," he said, shaking his head.
Hamas sent 20 rockets toward Israel. Most of the rockets were destroyed by Israel's antimissile shield. Others fell without hurting anyone. With the cease-fire in place, Gazans left shelters. They made their way home to ruined neighborhoods. Several cease-fires in the past broke down after fighting. Yet, some people hope this time might be different. "It's not just bread to eat," said Abdullah Mustafa, a father of seven.
The type of life they found is too small to be seen. NASA's Curiosity rover landed on the Red Planet in August 2012 to look for signs of life. The rover can drive around the planet like a car. Last Monday, scientists said the rover had made a discovery. It was in a hole on the surface of the planet. The hole is called a crater. This lake had just the right chemicals for life to thrive. It existed at around the same time that life was just starting on Earth.
The men who killed French journalists there said they were Muslims. They killed people at the Charlie Hebdo paper in Paris. The men were angry because of cartoons showing the Muslim Prophet Muhammad. Leaders at this mosque in Pennsylvania hope to fight back against violent groups. They are fighting against the hate that is being spread. Today, there are some violent groups around the world who say they are Muslims. There are the men who killed journalists in Paris. There is Boko Haram in Nigeria.
Companies that make airplanes are changing the way they do things: They no longer build wings and jet bodies out of metal. Instead, they build them out of carbon-fiber composites. This lightweight material is made from a blend of carbon and plastic. One thing is hard to find, though: good tools to cut and shape the new material. Now, a Washington engineering firm called Electroimpact says it has built a better tool. It says its new machine can handle carbon-fiber composites better than anything else out there. The new invention is known as an automated fiber placement, or AFP, machine.
They watched as boys and girls just like them were hurt. Some were forced to make decisions children shouldn't have to make. Like Jordy, they became soldiers in the same groups of fighters that ruined their lives. Children have been victims in virtually every battle in the Central African Republic. More than a year ago, a group that was against the government, known as the Seleka, took power away from the government. As many as 3,500 children marched with the Seleka. Other armed groups started fighting back, and the number of child soldiers grew to 6,000. Some children, like Jordy, were handed guns, while other children were made slaves.
But the last time a Democrat was elected mayor was 1989. David Dinkins won then. Abe Beame won the mayor's race by 40 points in 1973. That was the largest victory by somebody who wasn't already the mayor since 1897. Some votes were still being counted. Lhota worked for Rudolph Giuliani, who was mayor before Bloomberg. He was praised for how he ran the city's transportation agency during last year's Superstorm Sandy. But he struggled early on.
He is with the LAPD. "It's certainly something that's growing enormously." Drones usually come with a camera. They are piloted by computers on board. Drones are like an eye in the sky. People use drones to take pictures of sports events. Drones can take pictures of nature. They also can take pictures of people without them knowing.
What happens in these races could decide which political party controls the Senate. There are two main political parties in the United States. They are called the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. Members of each party have more or less the same ideas about running the government. The hometown question comes at a time when people really don't like politicians, which is another word for elected officials. Many people think politicians will do anything to get into power. People also think politicians will say whatever they think people want to hear. Not many voters approve how Congress is doing.
School officials hope the new system can keep students away from police and courts. Many schools started using a "zero tolerance" policy during 1970s and 1980s. That meant strict punishment for anyone breaking a rule. Zero tolerance punishments were popular for many years. It was unfair, with blacks and Latinos more likely to be punished than whites, activists say. There were 9,000 arrests and tickets in the 2011-2012 school year. More than 9 out of 10 of the arrests and tickets were for young black or Latinos. One out of 10 of the students in the district were black in 2013-2014.
Sanctions by Europe and the U.S. have hurt them more, experts said. Luckily, U.S. farms don't send as much food to Russia now as they once did, said Mike Cockrell. He's a boss at Sanderson Farms, a poultry producer. Cockrell said that in 2008, one-fifth of all poultry shipped from the U.S. went to Russia. Yet, Russian sales are still important. Sanderson Farms shipped 88 million pounds of poultry there last year. It was worth about $40 million. "Forty million dollars is certainly a lot of money," said Cockrell.
Neptune is four times larger than Earth. The 715 planets huddle around just 305 stars. Four of them are at the right distance from their stars to support life. When planets are too close to their star it's too hot for life to exist. The four planets are close enough to their stars that liquid water could remain stable. Water is necessary for life as we know it. The telescope stopped working last year. Yet before this happened the spacecraft turned up these strange and wonderful worlds.
Abstract Expressionism was the first American art style to be famous around the world. For a time, it put New York at the center of the art world. Paris was usually the center. Abstract Expressionist painters didn't paint people, scenery or objects. They valued creating in the moment, without planning. Pollock's painting can now be seen at the J. Paul Getty Museum. For years it was believed that Pollock painted "Mural" all at once. The usual story is that Pollock was unsure of what to do for months.
For many Americans, it is easy to check the right box on the form. They mark off "black," "white," "Hispanic," "Asian," or "American Indian." Some people check more than one box. It is not so easy for Americans of Middle Eastern and North African background (MENA). For more than 100 years, the MENA community has been labeled "white." But they range in skin color from pale to dark. They come from 22 different countries, from Iran to Egypt to Morocco. Now, the MENA community wants their own box added.
They hoped to end the military's grip on the country and take over. But the military is back in charge again. The signs are everywhere. Military tanks sit to control an area where people once camped out to support Mohammed Morsi. Kitchens that once prepared thousands of meals for the protesters are gone. Government bulldozers are there instead. A hospital where protesters were treated is now a burnt-out shell. Not a lot of people talk about democracy or creating a modern state now.
The result will be fewer people getting to vote based on their race, Holder said. Several Republican-governed states have passed new voting laws. Republicans argue that the changes are needed. They stop cheating, Republicans say. The laws are meant to make it harder for blacks and other people to vote. Those people would probably vote for Democratic candidates. Holder said his department could file more lawsuits about voting laws. "I fear that it will not be our last," he added.
He was not the first Ebola victim. However, he was the first to become sick with the disease in the United States. He was 42. Ebola is a very deadly illness. They also experience terrible headaches, muscle pain, diarrhea and vomiting. Ebola is spread when people touch the blood, vomit or spit of a sick person. The latest outbreak is centered in West Africa. Seven out of every 10 people who have gotten it there have died.
Most of those were discovered slithering over the ground. "The trouble is, these snakes spend much of their lives beneath the ground," said Robert Reed. That means that there are "many, many thousands more out there you can't see." Reed is an expert on invasive species. Brian Hinds is president of a group that studies snakes and other reptiles. He is going to Gran Canaria. Hinds has plans for dealing with the snakes. Among them: digging up the ground with machines.
Last week the judge who heard Banafa's case approved an agreement for both women. Abercrombie agreed that employees and people who wanted jobs could wear religious clothing. The only time they could not was if it would create an "undue hardship" for the company. "Undue hardship" is a legal term. The women's lawyers said the retailer will have trouble proving the headscarves cause a problem. The company already tried to show that the hijabs hurt Abercrombie's business. The judges both rejected their claims. Abercrombie will also set up a way for employees to appeal if the are told they cannot wear religious clothing.
That is about 1,500 years earlier than many scientists had thought they began making mummies. In fact, Buckley said the chemicals they found on the old cloth are similar to the ones the ancient Egyptians were using 3,000 years later. Buckley studies chemicals that were used in ancient cultures. Jones works with different types of textiles. Buckley now wants to study other burial sites in Ancient Egypt that are less old. He wants to learn how the Egyptians developed their way of burying the dead over the years from 4300 B.C. Before, people did not think that the early Egyptians were very advanced, Buckley said. He thinks his discovery will change that idea.
They ruin pipes. They harm farmland. Beaver dams also can flood homes. The government has an idea. They are like a beaver's dam. It is trying them out in streams. If the dams work, beavers can stay where they are.
It was just Warhol learning a new tool." People might think the museum could sell the Warhol images for a lot of money. But even if Warhol made them, it won't be easy for the museum to make money. Warhol often used popular pictures or products like the Campbell's soup cans in his work. That means they can't be used without permission. "We don't really see them as Warhol's artwork," Wrbican said. "So I don't think we're going to be putting them out there on coffee cups to sell any time soon."
For example, they may want something sweet. They may want a small, easy-to-carry container. "We can't just put a gallon of milk on a shelf and hope someone buys it," she said. Milk companies are trying to get children to drink more milk. One new container is shaped like a cow's head. Companies are also offering a new kind of packaging. It allows milk to be kept unrefrigerated. Businesses save money if they can keep milk without a refrigerator.
None of them had the flu. The scientists will keep looking for clues. The scientists who wrote the article said it's not clear how the new flu was spread. Understanding how a new flu virus moves is very important. Winter flus are the H1, H2 or H3 types. A flu shot can protect you against them. Marion Koopmans studies viruses in the Netherlands. Each person infected with an animal virus is seen as "a threat to public health," Koopmans said.
Researchers then looked at how fast or slow each creates new species. They also researched the speed at which extinction happens. The researchers also looked at how likely it was for each mammal to leave the tropics and move to the temperate zone. The temperate zone is a part of the Earth both north and south of the equator. It is not as warm as the tropics. The researchers found that in the tropics large numbers of new species were forming. And a low number of species were going extinct. This leads to a wide range of species.
Or it can be seen as a mini-planet called a dwarf. During the 1800s, it was considered a regular planet. Ceres confuses people because it is the largest and roundest object in a part of space filled with asteroids. But, most asteroids are not round like Ceres. Whatever it is, Ceres is looking more interesting these days. Scientists who study planets and space are called astronomers. They have discovered water vapor shooting off its surface. The vapor is like steam that is made when water is heated.
Should kids play tackle football? Players get bounced around. Even though they wear helmets, they bang their heads. Their brains might get hurt. Some scientists think kids should wait until they turn 12 before they start playing.
The team will continue looking for another year. It plans to build better equipment, and to use a bigger tank of xenon. The biggest problem is that scientists are not sure what dark matter is. The experiment has shown that some ideas were wrong, though. "It's ghost-like matter," scientist Daniel McKinsey said. Researchers "are really searching in the dark in a way," said scientist Avi Loeb. "We have no clue. We don't know what this matter is."
The ribbons were in honor of the teachers and students killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. The president talked more about gun control on Thursday on Google. He called the talk a "fireside hangout." President Franklin D. Roosevelt used to make informal radio broadcasts called "fireside chats." One hangout guest asked if the president wants to ban handguns. Obama replied that he didn't want to ban them. He only wants to ban certain military-type guns. He said he wants stricter rules for buying handguns.
MEXICO CITY " When tax time comes, artist Teresa Cito doesn't worry. She knows the government isn't after a single peso. Instead, what the taxman wants is one of her artworks. The money goes to help pay for the government. In Mexico, artists have an unusual choice: They are allowed to give works of art to the government instead of money. The idea, which is known as Payment in Kind, dates back to 1957. It has helped the government build a huge collection of modern art.
Many people who want to join don't know that. They're out of luck when they show up. Now they can't have crimes on their records. They have to finish high school. A pickier military affects the rest of the country. The military provides young people with jobs. It also helps them pay for college. Without those benefits they're likely to earn less money, studies have found.
It is called "E Pluribus Unum." It was made by Cuban-American artist Jorge Rodriguez-Gerada. The title is taken from one of the nation's best-known mottoes. In English, "E Pluribus Unum" means "Out of many, one." It means that the American states come together to make a single country. The motto is also a reminder that even though Americans are different in some ways, they are united. The artwork expresses the same idea. To design the face, Rodriguez-Gerada photographed 30 different young men of different races.
A group of building experts said so on Tuesday. The building is in New York. It beat out a building in Chicago called the Willis Tower. The decision was not simple. The tower in New York has a cone on top. It is called a spire. The spire does not have glass around it like the rest of the building. Some people say it is just decoration.
Still, India's elections "are likely to be freer and fairer than the exams." This is according to writer Mridula Chari. Teachers and school officials say that millions of students take the board exams each year. Few of them cheat. For rule-breakers, low-tech methods remain popular. Students hide cheat sheets in socks. They copy neighbors' answers. They scribble notes on walls.
They spent nights in tents attached to the rock. The tents hung 1,200 feet above the valley floor. The men kept climbing even after falls, little sleep and bloody fingers. Before Caldwell, no one ever thought to free climb the Dawn Face wall. The Dawn Face got its name because it catches the first sun rays in the morning. The Dawn Face has little for a climber to grab on to. It was climbed in 1970, but the climbers used more tools. Caldwell grew up in the shadow of Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado.
On July 3, 1863, Cushing was commanding a group of soldiers and cannons on the Gettysburg battlefield. Confederate guns killed many men in Cushing's unit. They destroyed all the big guns, except his. The attack became famous as Pickett's Charge. He was urged to go get medical help, but he refused to leave the battlefield. "He said ‘No, I'll fight it out or die in the attempt,'" said Kent Masterson Brown. He wrote a book about Cushing. The Battle of Gettysburg was the last great fight Confederate General Robert E. Lee made for the South, said Paul C. Jussel, He is a professor at the U.S. Army War College.
Now, the MENA community wants their own box added. They think being called "white" makes them invisible. They say the government gives them less help than they should be receiving. Census numbers decide who gets money from the government. A correct census makes sure states get money to help people. "Education is obviously a key point," says Sarab Al-Jijakli. He is a community organizer in Brooklyn, New York. He says one-quarter of the children at a Brooklyn school are Arab.
Then, try to grow a baby bird in an egg from the living pigeon. If all goes well, a copy of the long-lost Martha could hatch. One new bird would lead to another, and another. One day, large flocks of passenger pigeons might be seen flying in the skies. His goal is to bring back the passenger pigeon. Novak is studying genes taken from dead passenger pigeons. At the same time, he is studying the genes of a related bird: the band-tailed pigeon. So far, 32 passenger pigeon samples have been studied.
He finished a power-washing job and a computer repair job. Neal is impressed by how much Evan has learned about bitcoin. "He's 16, but it feels to me he is pretty much an expert in the field," Neal said. Unlike dollars, bitcoins are not backed by any government. Not everyone is in favor of bitcoin. People who use it are not identified by name. No one even knows who created it. Because names are secret, criminals and drug dealers use it.
Scientists followed him with a tracking collar. The wolf traveled about 3,000 miles after leaving his pack. Then, he started to act differently. He seemed to be settling in one area of Oregon. They put some cameras out in the forest in April. The cameras took photos of another wolf. That wolf was black. The black wolf squatted to pee.
They are sent to special centers called juvenile halls, or "juvie" for short. Many are waiting for their court trials. Some spend years there. They may even go on to adult prison. Budnick, and volunteers like him, try to help. Budnick's volunteer work began in 2003. A friend told him about InsideOut Writers. It is a volunteer program that offers writing classes for youths behind bars.
A coalition is many countries working together. He hopes a coalition will be able to destroy ISIL. He called the group a "network of death." The U.S. military has been dropping bombs in Iraq and Syria. The military said it destroyed eight ISIL vehicles in one bombing. Videos on Syrian social media showed people looking at destroyed houses. Reports from inside Syria said some non-fighters, or civilians, died in the bombings. Still, Obama called for toughness at the U.N.
Mohamed is 5-foot-1. She wears a blue and white police uniform and a hijab, a traditional Muslim headscarf. Kadra is a community officer. She doesn't carry a gun. She often helps other officers who need someone who can speak Somali. Mohamed sometimes rides with her partner, Tom Lee, 24, who works with Hmong immigrants from southeast Asia. Somalia has serious problems. War and violence are common there.
Children are fatter now then they were in the past. Professors wanted to know why. They wanted to know if pizza is to blame. They looked at pizza because so many kids eat it. They asked them to make a list of everything they eat and drink in day. Each day, one in five kids eat pizza. The only foods kids like more than pizza are desserts like cake, cookies and doughnuts. Grown-ups eat less pizza than kids.
There's something else. Because Diplodocus ate plants low to the ground, they took in a lot of sand. And chewing on sand wore down their teeth. And if your teeth get worn down quickly, guess what helps?
It is not easy to relax, or to feel positive. People with more money can afford to get counseling for their problems. The poor cannot, so they smoke to help themselves deal with their distress, Mallya said. The poor may also smoke more because they often live in places with no grocery stores. They see many cigarette ads in those types of stores, Mallya said. Mariana Chilton teaches health at Drexel University. She sees a link between smoking and poverty. When you don't have money, it creates mental and emotional suffering, said Chilton.
The English language has a lot of strange spelling rules. Take the letter grouping "ough," for example. It can be said different ways. There's "uhff" as in "rough" for one. Sometimes it is "off" as in "cough." A group of experts in Great Britain and the United States want to make changes. They say there should be a meeting called an International English Spelling Congress. The group would come up with a new spelling system.
The group calls itself the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and has also been called the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Levant is the English term for the region stretching from southern Turkey through Syria to Egypt. ISIL is trying to form a new country in the Middle East. It has already taken over parts of Iraq and Syria. "There can be no reasoning with this brand of evil," Obama said. "The only language understood by killers like this is the language of force." Obama spoke to world leaders at the United Nations. He said all countries must work together to fight violent groups.
It dropped from 42 percent in 1964 to 18 percent in 2012. The U.S. population grew. But the number of smokers in the U.S. has also dropped. It fell from 52 million in 1980 to 38 million in 2012. It is "one of the great public-health successes of the 20th century," wrote Thomas Frieden. He wrote an essay that was published with the study. But lung cancer is still the biggest cause of cancer deaths. Illnesses from tobacco kill 5 million people a year worldwide.
That is what most people in Turkey want, he explained. Other teachers said the fighting ignores real problems in the schools. They say the students are not getting a good education in Turkey's schools. Many schools have no labs or libraries, said Sakine Esen Yilmaz. Classes do not make students more religious, said Abbas Guclu. He is an education expert. He said young people spend more time watching TV or online. "It's not possible to control the youth of today," he said.
Briscoe was facing serious criminal charges that could have sent him to prison for 60 years. He dug through law books and found a mistake in the case against him. When his lawyer presented the mistake to the judge, Briscoe got only three years instead of 60. Briscoe is now dedicated to pursuing his dream: becoming a businessman who encourages young people to read and spreads a message of hope. He started a program to encourage prisoners to read: all the prisoners would give a little money, and the money would be used to get new books for the prison library. These days, Briscoe wants to help young people who may be facing the same temptations he did. Briscoe started a program called To Succeed You Must Read! It reaches out to students in schools and libraries.
Jesuits are a group of priests in the Catholic Church. They often work in areas like education and human rights. The pope wants people to worry about the poor. He says the church should worry less about social issues such as gay marriage. He has spoken against the world's worshipping of money. He also says it is an embarrassment that nearly 1 billion people today go hungry. People like the pope's simple style and sense of humor. Tens of thousands of people come out to see him.
These schools often want to help their athletes in many ways. Some of those ways, like extra tutoring, are good. But the classes that did not exist went too far. Now UNC has found itself in deep trouble. Counselors encouraged athletes to take certain classes in the African and Afro-American Studies department (AFAM). These classes never really took place. The students got grades of A or B without learning anything or doing any work. An office secretary, Deborah Crowder, would look over the students' research papers and assign grades.
"I love the Olympics," Graham said. "But I hate what the Russian government is doing throughout the world." Russia is doing several things that has angered the U.S. government. One is that it has been helping the president of Syria, Bashar al-Assad. The U.S. government would like to see him pushed out. Russia has been giving weapons to Assad. Another is that the Russians have let Edward Snowden stay in their country. Snowden is an American who gave away secrets about how the U.S. government spies on people in the country and overseas.
It can travel up to nearly 2,500 miles per hour (mph). The rocket plane is supposed to go to the edge of space, more than 60 miles above the Earth's surface. Six passengers and a pilot can fly on the rocket plane. In space, passengers will feel weightless. They will see the curve of the Earth's surface. Then the spaceship will re-enter the atmosphere and glide back to a runway. The company planned to charge customers $250,000 for the trip. Virgin Galactic said it has accepted more than $80 million from people who want tickets for the ride.
The money could be used for things like building schools and making bridges and roads. Ralph Gonsalves is prime minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines. He is one of the leaders. "It's a historic wrong that has to be righted," Gonsalves said. "It's not a confrontation, it's a conversation" that the Caribbean nations are seeking for the 400-year-old problem, Gonsalves said. "It's not a protest. It's an engagement." It is not clear if other nations will join the Caribbean's call.
This could help students feel rested. It may have other benefits as well. Maybe fewer students would be absent for class. Some may even do better work in school because they are not so tired. Will there be enough time for classes if the school day starts later? Will parents be able to get their kids ready for school before going to work? Starting school later may be difficult. Even so, the American Academy of Pediatrics says that schools should try it.
He votes on laws for the entire country. When Lewis was young, in the early 1960s, he was not allowed to vote. African-Americans in the South were not treated fairly. They could not vote. Now, Lewis has written comic books about those years. His latest book is called "March: Book Two." It shows the struggle to win equal rights for black people. Sometimes, pictures explain more than words alone.
Scientists called this event the end-Permian extinction. It has long been a mystery what caused it. Now they have an idea. A new study blames tiny microbes on the bottom of the ocean. The microbes in the new study are so small, about 1 billion of them could fit in a thimble-full of ocean dirt. But they were almost responsible for killing off all the life on our planet, the scientists suggest. The end-Permian extinction lasted 20,000 years. Scientists say that nearly nine-tenths of all life on Earth was destroyed.
The program was started by Deb Hall. She is a professor at Valencia College. Hall teaches classes about electricity. Electricity is needed to power lights, washing machines, televisions and many other machines. In 2009, Hall met with a company called We Care Solar. The company designs "solar suitcases." Solar suitcases are generators that are small enough that a person can carry one. These generators can bring electricity to areas that do not have it.
Their main purpose will be to spot changes in air pressure. What they find will be very useful to the National Hurricane Center. It will help determine how strong a storm could become. Hurricane season runs from June to November in the Atlantic Ocean. He works for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Coyotes weigh about 7 pounds. The planes are 5 feet long from the end of one wing to the end of the other. Coyotes can fly at speeds of up to 70 miles per hour.
The officials hope to learn lessons from a 2011 disaster in Japan. A 9.0 earthquake there created a huge tsunami that flooded coastal areas. That tsunami took people by surprise. It killed more than 10,000 and left more than 300,000 homeless. A meltdown at the plant spread dangerous radiation in the area, making some people and animals sick. Researchers hope to save lives by quickly spotting tsunamis. They have installed tsunami detectors deep under the ocean. Predicting a tsunami's strength is important to saving lives.
One thing might make that less likely: if healthy African elephants can be bred with captive elephants in zoos. Zoos have been trying hard to breed the elephants they have in captivity. They haven't been having too much luck. Getting elephants to mate and give birth is tricky when they are not in the wild. Two baby elephants were born in zoos in Austria and England. It didn't happen the natural way. The babies were artificially fathered with semen taken from wild South African elephants. Semen is a liquid that males release while mating.
For instance, La Canada High School had 127 visits from recruiters between August and November. Palisades Charter had 133. The private Marlborough School had 102. But in poor areas, Pasadena High School had 20 visits over the fall semester. Santa Ana High had five. Belmont High near downtown Los Angeles had about 25. Jefferson principal Michael Taft said it is harder for poorer schools to set up visits from colleges. His school can no longer afford a full-time college counselor.
WASHINGTON " The National Mall is the stretch of parks and museums in Washington, D.C. Its nickname is "the nation's front lawn." It is called this because it is a green, open space and is next to some the country's most important government buildings. This October, there is an extra reason to go. On Oct. 1, a new art project opened at the Mall. It is not made of paint. It does not hang on a wall.
Pasadena is trying to solve this problem. The California city wants to make sure the money helps people. It is testing a new way to give money to panhandlers who ask for dollars and coins on the streets. Fourteen parking meters in the city have been changed. Now they will collect change to go to charities that help the homeless. The meters have been painted bright orange. They are decorated with smiley faces. They are meant to make people aware of the city's homeless programs.
He said that he sometimes has to dig in lonely places in the countryside. There are no other people around to take an interest in his work. But The Hill is in the middle of town. So the researchers and local people are getting to know each other. He wants to write a paper that he says really matters, and not something that just "sits on the shelf." He said, "I like the opportunity to tell stories that haven't been told."
Its home is a sparkling new kitchen in Philadelphia's Central Library. Siobhan Reardon is head of the library. She said the center will teach people to cook. It also will help them learn to read. At least half of Philadelphia's adults are known as "low literate." That's half a million people. A "low-literate" person doesn't read well. Cooking is "science, it's math, it's literacy.
He was 18 years old. People in the community were upset. They held protests. They wanted a change in how police treat the people of their town. They felt Brown's death was not right. To keep the protests calm, police departments sent officers. The police had armored cars, large guns and body armor. They looked more like soldiers than police.
Then, they posted pictures and video clips on the internet showing them driving. The women could have been arrested for their actions. Things are slowly getting better for Saudi women who want to drive. More people support the idea. On Tuesday, a female member of the important Shoura Council suggested women should be allowed to drive. The Council was appointed by Saudi Arabia's leader, King Abdullah. It advises the government. But right now Saudi women cannot get a driver's license.
"There were 150 people there; 149 of them were properly dressed," she said the journalist wrote. "As first daughters, you can't win," Davis wrote to the girls. There will be always be people who are angry with their own lives, ready to take it out on you, she continued. Because Obama is the first African-American president, he carries important symbolism, said James Peterson of Lehigh University. Many first daughters have faced criticism. Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh once called President Jimmy Carter's daughter, Amy, the "most unattractive presidential daughter in the history of the country." He later apologized. Limbaugh later attacked 13-year-old Chelsea Clinton.
"It was curiosity," Shubham explained. "I'm always thinking up something. If you think it can be done, then it can probably be done." Shubham was invited to the White House to show his printer. On Tuesday, Intel Corporation said it will give money to Braigo to help build the printers. Intel is one of the largest makers of computer chips. The money will let Shubham hire workers to make his printer. Then he can think more about school.
He thinks Beitashour did the right thing accepting Iran´s invitation. "I don't want them to miss out on anything. If this is what they badly want, then absolutely fine," he said. The next hurdle for Beitashour is being chosen to join the Iranian team. "I have a good feeling that he´ll be on the squad come the World Cup," says Namazi.
It also raises a question: Why has it taken them nearly 70 years to examine their collections this closely? It also suggests something else. More looted art may show up in countries that have not yet looked so closely. "These objects are either thought or known to have been" taken by the Germans during the war, said Siebe Weide. Weide runs the Netherlands Museums Association. The art included 69 paintings. One of them was painted by French artist Henri Matisse in 1921. It is called "Odalisque."
They think the boy's trip could say something about how safe and secure American airports really are. If a teenager could hop over a fence and onto a plane, why couldn't a terrorist? There have been many airport break-ins in the past few years. They have all come through the outside fences. The California teenager survived a 5½-hour, nonstop flight to Maui, Hawaii. "Somebody can come onto an airport and get to the wheel well of an airplane," Brian Jenkins said. If this is true, it means that "someone else can plant a bomb." Jenkins works for a group that studies different issues for the government.
"The Brazilian people are not against the World Cup" said Edgar Reinoso on Thursday in Rio. But they are against the amount of money being spent on stadiums, said the 61-year-old. "For Brazilians to come to the streets this way, it means a lot is wrong," he said as he coughed on tear gas. Brazil has grown richer in recent years. Since 2003, about 40 million Brazilians have become middle class. The rich have been buying apartments in Miami. Even the middle class had begun to enjoy shopping trips to Florida. "Those 40 million who have entered the middle class have seen the promised land and they have liked it very much," said Paulo Sotero.
Apple revealed the new iPhones at its headquarters in California. The phones will go on sale on Sept. 20. Why sell a cheaper phone? Not everybody can spend so much on new electronics. But people there do not have as much money. The 5C costs less. It may help Apple sell more phones to the Chinese. And in other places.
Scientist Miriam Goldstein has studied the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. This huge area of plastic debris lies between Hawaii and California. Goldstein and fellow scientist Deb Goodwin looked at barnacles living in the patch. One-third of them had plastic bits in their guts. Crabs eat barnacles. And crabs in turn are eaten by other animals. This means that the plastic that barnacles eat is spreading through the food web. It may be reaching all the way to people.
Tornados come with little warning. People may only know a few minutes ahead of time that a storm is on its way. But scientists have worked to get warnings earlier. They use balloons and radar. And they have people watching from the ground. Now they want to warn people hours ahead of time.
After that, the government may be unable to pay its bills. Congress gets to make laws. Those laws require money. But later it says the government can't borrow the money. Well, the Founding Fathers made it that way. The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to make laws. Congress also gets the power to raise money. But the Constitution also says the president carries out the laws passed by Congress.
Ben Alamar works for an NBA team. He is excited about data in basketball. The NBA's system shows how helpful data can be. Big data is helping scientists explore outer space. It is also helping basketball teams learn some things about their players for the first time. All sports are using data to make better decisions, said Brian Kopp. He works for a sports data company. "Basketball is pushing the front edge of that conversation."
A low-flow toilet uses just 1.6 gallons or less. People should also flush less often Attari says. That would also decrease the amount of water used in the home, she said. "If it's yellow, let it mellow," she recommends. Experts say the next greatest water saver is a better clothes washer. A typical washer opens from the top. Those models use about 34 gallons per load. But, a washer that opens from the front will use less than 15 gallons.
He has studied sharks for a long time. Other scientists are doing another count. It will show there are more than 2,000 white sharks. Sharks are hard to count, said Barbara Block. It is easier to count elephants or lions, she said. But you can't miss 2,000 sharks. Chris Lowe is a scientist. He has been studying white sharks.
WASHINGTON " Tons of deadly chemicals were collected from Syria after a poison gas attack last summer. But figuring out what to do with them has been a problem. The U.S. military is putting special machines on a cargo ship. The machines will be used to destroy the chemicals. Officials said two machines have been put on the ship, named the Cape Ray. They are called hydrolysis machines.The machines use water or bleach to destroy the chemicals.
People are starting to ask questions about fishing for sharks. Is fishing like this allowed? Is the shark likely to live after being let go? David Shiffman, who studies ocean science, doesn't like videos of such catches. They should note that hammerheads are endangered. Pulling them onto the beach is against the law in Florida. People are not supposed to take pictures before they let the animals go, said Shiffman. Captain Rama Shuster, a state wildlife official, said catch-and-release fishing laws mean people have to let caught fish go.
There's even a coat tree with several lab coats hanging from it. The coats are embroidered with the names of retired scientists. Copies of original notes and letters are displayed on the two floors of the tower. Among them is an odd company memo: It recommends that sunglasses be worn inside the tower. Art expert Brady Roberts called the tower "mind-blowing." "The purpose was to inspire scientists," he said. So it's striking that many of the products invented there are still well known in the 21st century. "That's sort of incredible."
She is a conservative, meaning that she supports traditional ideas. Many conservatives think some schoolbooks say too many bad things about America. They believe that reading such material will change students' thinking. Students, they fear, will become rebellious. Williams' plan was created because of a change in how history is taught in schools across the country. The change is to look at both the bad in American history along with the good. Williams and other conservatives do not agree with that. Supporters of the new approach to history say it gives a more balanced view.
Then they tested it for bacteria. They tested for two kinds of bacteria, E.coli and Staph. Bacteria are tiny. Millions can fit on a pencil eraser. There are good and bad bacteria. We have good bacteria in our stomachs. These bacteria help us break down food. Bad bacteria can cause illness.
It shows he is setting an example by getting rid of the weapons. The OPCW was formed in 1997. At that time, countries around the world decided to outlaw chemical weapons. Never before had an entire type of weapon been banned. Then, there was talk of poison gas attacks in Syria. The United Nations asked the OPCW to look into it. Syria is joining the OPCW on Monday. It will be the 190th country to become a member.
So we have to keep water temperatures from getting too high. There is one good way to do this: burning less fuels. Driving a car burns fuel. Heating a house burns fuel. All these things put carbon dioxide in the air. This is making temperatures rise slowly. People call it global warming. Chris Bergh is a conservationist.
Children need to master computer keyboarding. And most grown-ups do not use cursive in everyday life. Instead, they use a mix of cursive and print. Morgan Polikoff studies education. Think about what skills will help students find good jobs in the future, he said. Keyboarding is more likely to help than cursive. States are allowed to offer courses not on the Common Core list. But in many schools, classroom time is limited.
"Hamlet" is the story of Prince Hamlet of Denmark. Hamlet is son of the king and heir to the throne. He is off studying in Germany. When Hamlet returns home to Denmark, he finds out from a ghost that his uncle has murdered his father, married his mother, and named himself king.
Cuba had a violin factory during the 1970s. However, the wood in Cuba is not very good for making some instruments. It has nowhere near the quality of the best European woods like maple. Right now, Martinez's workshop needs money to stay open. Martinez says he hopes the workshop will soon make enough money so it will not need help. Whether or not Martinez succeeds isn't only important to him. The future of Cuban music may depend just a little on his workshop. "It's like with people," said Juan Carlos Prado, one of Martinez's workers.
But on Tuesday night, the White House hosted one just for kids. The young guests walked into the White House as a harp played. They moved into the largest room in the White House called the East Room. Tables filled the room so guests could be seated for an eight-course meal. First lady Michelle Obama hosted the meal. It was less formal. Instead of using silverware, the guests were allowed to eat with their fingers. The kids won a healthy recipe contest called the Healthy Lunchtime Challenge.
These machines can take over the work of humans. Some workers will have to find new jobs. It is one of the problems of technology. As more technology is used in farming, jobs will be lost. Technology does the jobs that humans do, he said. There will be jobs lost, but "society generally benefits."
A bicycle inner tube, cooking racks and pool "noodles" help the robot float. The team formed a few years ago with elementary and middle school children. They thought it would be just an after-school neighborhood nerd club. Soon they started beating high schoolers. It wasn't easy. Sometimes their robot would die 10 minutes before the contest. The girls raised the money for their trip to Romania. They are not in it just for themselves.
Why are grown-ups arguing about a stuffed animal? Well, grown-ups used to be kids, too. Many of them grew up with Pooh and love him. Maybe that is why they care about where the stuffed bear should be. Should Pooh stay in New York or go back to England? Unfortunately, we cannot just ask Pooh where he wants to live. Unlike the Winnie-the-Pooh from the stories, this Pooh does not talk.
What he turned up instead was something "weird," Romanowsky said. It was unlike anything Romanowsky had ever seen. Think of a dwarf galaxy as being like an apple core, Romanowsky said. What Sandoval found is like the seeds. Until recently, scientists hadn't thought to search for dense star systems. "It's something that's been hiding in plain sight," Romanowsky said. The new discoveries could reshape our understanding of the universe. Both students were passionate about the project, Romanowsky said.
Five of those have been damaged in the war, said a new report. Richard Leventhal runs the Cultural Heritage Center at the University of Pennsylvania. He works with Brian Daniels. Their group wrote the new report. It can tell us who we are and where we come from. If important heritage sites are destroyed, people can lose their identity, Leventhal said. Daniels compares the situation in Syria to a home that is on fire. The heritage sites in Syria are like family photos.
The result is increasing ozone pollution there. Winds carry the ozone from China to the U.S. It only takes about a week for the gas to be blown across the Pacific. The ozone then adds to pollution created by American cars and factories. They are closer to the Pacific Ocean, so the ozone reaches them first. Smog has become much worse in California's cities like Bakersfield, Fresno and Los Angeles. It will not be easy to stop pollution from China, said scientist Owen Cooper. The U.S. and China would have to work out a deal.
In 1775, the American Revolution began. The war started because the American colonies did not want to be part of Great Britain anymore. George Washington led the Revolutionary Army to victory in 1783. The colonies then became the United States of America. The Lansdowne is one of the best paintings we have of President Washington. There are few pictures of his whole body. It shows Washington standing in a black velvet suit. This was how he dressed as president.
CHICAGO " There's a farm hidden in a quiet corner of the city of Chicago in Illinois. The 2-year old farm is the size of a football field. The farm is also special because it is the only farm in the entire state of Illinois where people from distant countries take care of the plants and vegetables. The farmers came from countries around the world. Others are from the Asian nations of Bhutan and Myanmar. Many of them were forced to leave their homes. They are called "refugees" because they came to the United States for a safe place, or refuge, to live. The farm is a place where these refugee farmers can return to their old lives.
He hopes that this time it will finally work. After hearing of the new changes, he decided to "give it another whirl," Koetsier said. Greenhouse gases like methane are harmful to the planet. Cow dung isn't the only thing that releases greenhouses gases. California wants to cut down on greenhouse gases. And that is causing power companies to look for new power sources. Unlike coal, there's a never-ending supply of manure. Experts say digesters could work for California.
Hold your nose before reading this: Doctors are putting healthy people's poop into pills. And these pills are being used to cure people. This is a terrible gut infection. Scientists tried the new treatment on 27 patients. They cured them all. Yes, it's a disgusting idea.
But it was not the first time thieves did such a daring crime. It has happened many times. And a lot of criminals have gotten away, too. One of the biggest robberies happened in February 2005 in the Netherlands at an airport in Amsterdam. Two men pretending to be airline employees drove a truck onto the runway and stole millions of dollars worth of diamonds from another truck parked nearby. The thieves have never been found. In February 2003, a group of men at the Antwerp World Diamond Centre in Antwerp, Belgium, pretended they were diamond merchants and broke into a vault. They stole millions of dollars worth of diamonds, but were caught a few days later.
But that doesn't mean they really know the subject. But some parents don't like the new system. They worry their kids wouldn't do homework if they didn't have to turn it in. "That's not real life," said Paul Bozdech. Teachers don't help kids by giving them grades they don't deserve, he said. "At some point, they are going to fall on their face," he said. The usual way of grading can hide failure. A student might earn a D in math.
The Air Force uses it to attack enemy vehicles on the ground. But the U.S. military needs to save money. So the Warthog's flying days may soon be over. The plane comes from the 1970s. The gun is the size of a small car and is in the plane's nose. The A-10 is known for tearing apart tanks. It clears the way for troops on the ground with its huge bullets. But military officials do not like the plane.
The ice will keep the lakes cooler in summer. It also helps wildlife. Eggs of cold-water fish are better protected in icy waters. But not everyone likes the freeze. Also, ships can't get through the ice. Shipping has nearly stopped. Trips through the Great Lakes normally take two days. Now they take seven days or more.
She is very far from Mexico. She can still learn mariachi. Her school has a new mariachi program. This makes Alexa's father happy. He loves mariachi. Now he and his daughter can enjoy mariachi together. Alexa goes to Richard Edwards Elementary School. The mariachi lessons are new.
But the U.S. government does not allow people to use a drone to sell things. The government office that controls U.S. airspace is the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). It has been working since 2008 on rules for drones. It expects to publish final regulations this year. One of these groups is the National Association of Realtors. The association represents real estate workers. It asked its members to stop using drones for now. It has also asked the FAA to come out with the final rules soon.
They will discuss new ways of thinking about refugees. Perhaps Central Americans can be considered refugees. If that happens, the U.N. said, it could mean one big change. Central Americans may no longer be "automatically sent to their home countries." Most people considered to be refugees are fleeing wars. Central Americans are fleeing crime. Many Central American countries have been taken over by gangs. Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras are among the most dangerous countries on Earth.
Akasaki was also called by phone. Yet, the Nobel Prize committee had not yet reached Amano when it made the announcement. He happened to be flying from Japan to France. Every year, likely winners wait near their telephones on the day the prize is announced. "I think actually they were not prepared for it," said Staffan Normark. He is with the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which runs the Nobel Prize committee. "They had not been waiting all day or all night for this call."
The president was given greater powers in 2010, when a change was made to the constitution. Protesters demand a return to the constitution as it was before. On Tuesday afternoon, protesters hit the streets. They began marching toward the parliament building. The demonstrators grew angry after the government announced that parliament wouldn't discuss changes to the constitution right now. Police tried to block the crowd of about 20,000 from entering the parliament. Some protesters managed to get into the building. Others succeeded in breaking into the ruling party's main office.
For the third time in 10 years, the Red Sox won the national baseball championship. They carried the World Series trophy through their city in a "rolling rally" of "duck boats." The boats have wheels so they can drive like trucks. But, they can also float in the water. The most emotional moment happened early Saturday. The vehicles stopped at the Boston Marathon finish line. The spot was near where two explosions killed three people watching the race on April 15. Outfielder Jonny Gomes placed the trophy on the finish line.
As he works, various birds stand around, waiting for the fields to fill up with water. In two weeks, there will be thousands of birds. They will be busy swimming, resting and hunting bugs. Without these temporary wetlands, birds would be in even more trouble, Munger said.
LOS ANGELES " Some day years from now, Los Angeles will have several new subway stations. Seventy feet below Wilshire Boulevard, subway construction crews are busy. They are digging up dirt and drilling through rock. But the underground work isn't only about subways. The other day, Kim Scott was busy with her own task.
ATLANTA " The Barbie doll has had many jobs. In a new book, she is a computer engineer  " someone who builds apps, websites and video games. The book is called "Barbie: I Can Be a Computer Engineer." In it, Barbie is helping to create a video game. But, as bloggers on the Internet pointed out, Barbie is not actually making the game.
She said families can help their their kids be healthier, even if they have to change some habits. Changing habits is not always easy, but it is not impossible. Lavizzo-Mourey said Americans have changed their habits before. Smoking used to be more popular than it is today. Lavizzo-Mourey said that eating and exercise habits can change, too. Five years ago, Obama began a program called "Let's Move!" It tries to get kids to exercise more so they don't get overweight. In some ways, the health of American children has gotten better.
The leaked papers show that America's NSA and Britain's GCHQ spy agency have worked together. They're both trying to gain information from the apps. Some apps are considered "leaky." Those apps may be feeding huge amounts of information to the spy agencies. What groups a person joins can be found out too. The size of the spying program isn't known. Yet, the reports suggest that the spy agencies can easily collect information from apps. Two of the biggest apps mentioned in reports are "Angry Birds" and Google Maps.
The plan was suggested by school board member Julie Williams. She is a conservative, meaning that she supports traditional ideas. Many conservatives think some schoolbooks say too many bad things about America. They believe that reading such material will change students' thinking. They will no longer feel proud of their country. Williams' plan was created because of a change in how history is taught in schools across the country. The change is to look at both the bad in American history along with the good. Williams and other conservatives do not agree with that.
Together, they developed a military code based on the Navajo language. The code was unbreakable. The men risked their lives in the fight against the Japanese in World War II. They sent and decoded highly important military messages. He didn't have to volunteer. Native Americans were hardly considered citizens back then. But Nez's pride in his people was strong. "I reminded myself that my Navajo people had always been warriors, protectors," he wrote years later.
It's definitely not safe, new studies have shown. Hookah smokers breathe in smoke harder and longer than cigarettes. It means that even more nicotine and carcinogens enter their lungs. Hookah smoke also has high levels of carbon monoxide. "If you know cigarettes are dangerous, then there is absolutely no reason to be smoking a water pipe," Eissenberg says. "Water pipe smoking will kill you also." Farhad Ata owns Kush Hookah Lounge. He's been smoking hookah his entire life, but knows it's not healthy.
Each has its own tricky effect: For example, there's the frost in "Rise of the Guardians." Then there's the cannon fire in "Kung Fu Panda 2." Or there's the ice-breathing dragon in "How to Train Your Dragon 2." His latest challenge was creating those bubbles in "Home." They're also spaceships for the aliens. Making a picture of a bubble on a flat surface isn't too hard. What's much trickier is this: Wrapping that picture around a floating shape that's a bit like a soccer ball. Henderson set out to solve the problem.
WASHINGTON " Calorie counts must be listed on most packaged foods. Now, many food sellers must also list calories. Too many calories can make people gain weight. The government announced the new rules on Tuesday. They include large restaurant chains, theme parks and movie theaters. Too many Americans are overweight.
That means the government owns many of the businesses. It sets prices for many things, even food. People cannot buy and sell on their own as much. When Chavez was president, his government took over many businesses. He won the election in 2012 by a few votes. He died from cancer soon after. His vice president took over and has kept most of his plans. Children are back in school now after their winter break.
"It's something that's new," said Matt Wrbican. He is an expert on Warhol at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh. "And that doesn't happen very often with Warhol." The whole story was revealed Thursday morning. They are the Andy Warhol Museum, Carnegie Mellon University and the Carnegie Museum of Art. Warhol once predicted  that "everyone would be world-famous for 15 minutes." The Pittsburgh-born artist died in 1987. He is still famous as the King of Pop Art.
The callers complain of horses hit by cars. Some report horses running free. "I can only hope that it's not going to get worse," Boudreau said. Illinois has laws about animal abuse and neglect. County animal control departments can issue fines. Rescue groups and volunteers may handle some abuse and neglect calls. Sheriffs and police officers can investigate cases. They have the power to seize animals when an owner is arrested.
Lauten works for a congressman from Tennessee. She was writing about an event last Wednesday. Malia and Sasha stood to the side as their father went through a yearly presidential tradition: pardoning a Thanksgiving turkey at the White House. Pardoning a prisoner lets him out of jail. On Friday, Lauten apologized for her Facebook comments. "I reacted to an article and quickly judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged as a teenager," she wrote. The apology was not enough. Lauten quit her job on Monday.
The desert experiment was a test of the unit that would send back information from Mars. But how will that information be received? That technology already exists as well, Venter said. The device downloads a DNA message. It will be available for sale in 2014. Venter says it will be the size of a computer printer at some point. This technology will have many uses on Earth, Venter said. For example, people will be able to "download" and "print out" medicines at home.
It would do this by putting a tariff on things like pork, chocolate and a lot of other stuff from the United States. A tariff is a fee on something from outside of the country. Canada complained to the World Trade Organization. The WTO hears trade fights between countries. Groups that favor labeling sued the department last year. They said the government was too slow to put the new rules in effect. Consumer groups say Americans want labeling. Nine of 10 people think packages should have to say where meat comes from, one pole said.
But it's not required. A review by the Associate Press found that schools handle this in different ways. Schools don't agree on what to look for or at what age to check. They don't agree if schools should screen kids for these problems at all. Mike Dennis teaches health care workers how to help people with mental illness and drug use. Schools screen kids for all kinds of diseases, he said. But they don't try to find behavior problems early. This doesn't make sense, he said.
Imagine a city where 1 out of every 3 children is poor. One out of every 10 adults cannot find a job. Imagine a place where 4 out of 10 students never finish high school. Their future is not very bright. That was New Haven, Connecticut, just a few years ago. Many of New Haven's youths had no way out of poverty. They looked ahead to their future and saw no opportunities.
People of all colors and races live in France. The French government thinks it knows why many immigrants or people of different religions are angry. They do not feel like they belong. So the French government is making changes. The government wants children to learn French values. Prime Minister Manuel Valls worries that the French people are becoming divided. He said this divide could be seen most in the "banlieues." Banlieues are the suburbs outside cities.
That could be a problem for the animals: the great gray owl, the Sierra Nevada red fox and the Pacific fisher. The fire hit the Stanislaus National Forest and Yosemite National Park. It burned 257,000 acres. The area houses a group of roughly 200 great gray owls. The blaze also came within 12 miles of 10 pairs of the red fox. The foxes are breeding. Their young could keep the animals around for future generations. The Sierra Nevada red fox lives in the mountains.
The signing was held in the Kremlin. The Kremlin is a historic fortress in Moscow. Shortly before the ceremony, Putin gave a heated speech. He blamed Ukraine's new leaders for the takeover. A Ukrainian nationalist is a patriot. A Russophobe is anti-Russian. An anti-Semite is someone who hates Jews. In February, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych fled Ukraine.
He was a Spanish priest who built missions up and down the state in the 1700s. The missions were used to spread Christianity to Native Americans. At the time, California was controlled by Spain. The missions were used by the Spanish military and Catholic priests. Some see Serra as a good man. They say he left Spain to help people in Mexico and the United States. Others say he took advantage of Native Americans, forcing them to build the missions in difficult conditions. Pope Francis is the head of the Roman Catholic Church.
His wife invited him to speak to a class she was teaching. It was the first time he talked to kids about his experience during the war. Then the Museum of Tolerance asked him to speak to visitors there. The Museum teaches about the Jews wartime experience. So far, about 1,000 children have heard about his escape from Poland. Jesus Mendoza, a 17-year-old senior, said he could relate to Prochnik's past because his immigrant family gave up a life in Mexico to come to this country for better schooling. Jesus's father has a third-grade education; his mother finished second grade, he said. "I've never heard anyone who actually went through what people like my parents have," Jesus said.
RIO DE JANEIRO " The head of the Catholic Church visited a dangerous slum on Thursday. He told people living there that their government must do a better job of helping them. He has 1.2 billion followers around the world. The comments he made might cause a fuss. But they were not surprising. He is known for caring about fairness and the problems of the poor.
Instead, Kepler might be picking up drops in light when two stars block each other. Scientists used a new way of finding these 715 planets. Planets seem to cluster in systems with other planets. Stars don't usually orbit each other. The new method found that several planets orbiting around a single star is common. That is just like in our own solar system. It doesn't happen by chance, Lissauer said. He said the new method could lead to finding new planets on a large scale.
Serious criminals and people who have recently crossed the border will be tracked down by police. They may be forced to leave the U.S. People who have been in the U.S. for more than 10 years will not be. Obama said his actions were not an amnesty. An amnesty for illegal immigrants would forgive them for entering the U.S. illegally. An amnesty would affect all illegal immigrants. Obama's actions mostly affect parents and young people. One group will benefit most: adult immigrants who have been in the U.S. illegally for more than five years. Some have children who are citizens or permanent residents.
If they have more money, the country does well. Obama wants middle class Americans to pay less in taxes. He also wants to make it easier for them to go to college by making community college free. Obama is also asking lawmakers to give workers more vacation time or sick days. Republicans disagree with many of the president's ideas for laws. Iowa lawmaker Joni Ernst gave the Republican response. She said Republicans and Democrats should work together. However, Ernst still disagreed with Obama in many ways.
It is not known what the state's doctors found. As night fell in Ferguson Sunday, a protest became violent. Marchers pushed toward one end of a street. Police pushed them back with tear gas. Tear gas is used to stop protests. Officials said protesters had shot guns, destroyed property and set fires. At least two people were shot by protesters, an official said. Officers ordered all protesters to leave.
Chris Christie signed a bill that makes it against the law to try to change children from gay to straight. The governor said Monday that he signed the bill even though he was not very willing. Some people believe treatment can change to whom a gay person is attracted. Others say its not possible and that it does harm. Christie said he had concerns about the law. He did not like limiting parents' choices of care and treatment for their children. Christie said he decided to sign the bill after looking at what doctors said about the treatment. He pointed out the American Psychological Association's opinion.
The reefs are not just pretty. They are very important to South Florida. Divers, boaters and fishermen come from all over to see them. They spend a lot of money on their visits. But South Florida's reefs have been doing very badly for years. Pollution is to blame. Higher water temperatures hurt too. Many people worry that the reefs might die out completely.
He has not explained what happened. He did, however, call his actions "totally inexcusable." Rice won't be going to jail, so only the NFL will punish him. He will sit out two games and will have to pay a fine of around $500,000. For a big-time football player, though, it's not so much. Still, Rice argues that he will suffer. "My daughter is 2 years old now," he said. "Me having to explain that to her, what happened that night, that's something I have to live with the rest of my life."
Often, they are used in planning terrorist attacks like bombings. The NSA says it is not interested in "everyday Americans." The agency says it only collects information "that we are authorized by law to collect." GCHQ said its activity was legal and "necessary." Snowden's other leaks have shown that. However, the interest in apps is new. "Angry Birds" was one of the most eye-catching examples. The game has been downloaded more than 1.7 billion times worldwide.
The effects in many animated movies are "incredibly complicated," said computer scientist Paul Debevec. To get them right, you need "real scientists." DreamWorks has one of the largest groups of scientists: around 120 in all. DreamWorks has even hired biologists. They are there to show artists how to correctly draw such things as tree branches. Henderson finds working at DreamWorks very satisfying. Science can be "very lonely," he said. "I wanted to have the experience of working with people and being able to see the results of what I did."

A lot of people got a new electronic device for Christmas this year. The old electronics can become a pollution problem. Some contain materials that can be dangerous. There are nearly 50 million tons of electronic junk thrown out around the world each year. The Solving the E-Waste Problem Initiative made that estimate.
The United States has had the measles vaccine since 1963. Still, the disease spread across the country in 1976-77 and 1989-91. In 1977, about 50,000 students in Los Angeles County were told to stay home from school. These students either had to get the shot, or prove they had gotten it before. The number of measles cases dropped quickly. Today measles is spreading in California. Some parents who did not let their children get the shot are changing their minds. One mother at a park in Newport Beach said she changed her mind about her 2 1/2-year-old daughter.
Tens of thousands of Yazidis escaped to Mount Sinjar. Iraqi Yazidis could die in large numbers, President Barack Obama said. The United States is dropping water and food to Yazidis in danger of starving. Hundreds of Yazidis live in Lincoln, Nebraska. Yazidis here have seen videos and photos of relatives and children begging for help. When they cook in Nebraska, they cry. They know their relatives in Iraq have nothing to eat. When they see their beds, they think of their family members trapped on the mountaintop.
It doesn't develop businesses in Africa, some say. Instead, it simply buys up raw materials like oil and minerals. It then processes them " treats and prepares them for use " back in China. African countries end up making less money than they might otherwise. In addition, Chinese companies in Africa rarely hire African workers. The only jobs Africans get are the lowest-level ones. The United States wants to do things differently, Obama said. It won't be about removing "minerals from the ground" to benefit the United States, Obama said.
Neurons were also used while working with the woodblock stamps. Neurons are cells that send information to and from the brain. Scientists placed neurons into a grid shape. Then they watched how they share information. The scientists call this new type of printing block-cell printing. They found that it could be done in just half an hour. Unlike inkjet printing, it doesn't kill any of the cells being used. There are some drawbacks.
Five days later, Christin was in the hospital. Doctors took the magnets out. Along with the magnets, doctors removed part of her colon. The colon is beneath the stomach. Many magnet toys include warnings. They tell people not to put magnets in their mouths or noses. But that has not stopped a growing number of kids from doing that. "Kids swallow a lot of objects," said Dr. Tejas Mehta.
Its neck has no feathers on it. Schmidt said the chicken's bare neck helps keep it cool. He said that's what chicken farmers need " self-cooling chickens. Schmidt is trying to map the chicken's genes. They direct how living things grow and develop. Schmidt wants to discover which genes keep the chickens cool. Then he will try to put those genes into U.S. chickens. Schmidt made a prediction.
Gordon said that move probably will push the fast-food industry to raise the lowest prices to above a dollar. Prices for fast food are rising. But consumers also have begun questioning the quality of low-cost menus. Those menus rarely include fruits and vegetables. NPD found that low-cost menu orders at fast-food restaurants fell in 2011 and 2012. Sales of combo meals are also down in the past five years. McDonald's is trying to bring back health-minded customers. The company plans to offer salads, fruit or vegetables in value meals in some cities.
He said using chemical weapons on their people would be crossing a "red line." He did not explain what he meant by "red line." However, political experts say it may mean the U.S. military would try to help throw out the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. Syria is in the Middle East. Last month, the prime minister of Turkey said on U.S. television that Syrians were fleeing into his country. Some of them showed signs of chemical weapon injuries. The Turkish leader said al-Assad had already crossed the "red line." He called on the United States to do something.
Michael P. Huerta is the leader of the FAA. Huerta told Congress that he would like to end the no-fly zones over Disney. Defenders of the no-fly zones say the Disney parks deserve special protection. They say the parks have a special place in people's hearts. If airplanes could fly over Disney, there could be terror attacks. Others say the no-fly zones could not stop a terror attack. They think the law mostly hurts pilots who tow the ad banners. "Banner towers used to make money with their banner tows around Disneyland.
They put the microphones next to the hot plate, where the kernels were heating up. The microphones and cameras were set up to work together. The scientists wanted to see exactly when the sounds happened. They waited for the kernels to explode. The experiment showed that the water vapor inside the kernel makes the sounds. Sometimes at the end of the day's experiment, the team would celebrate by eating the popcorn together.
It would eventually be destroyed. Avoiding force in Syria will strengthen the trust between Russia and the United States, he wrote. "It will be our shared success and open the door to cooperation on other" important problems. The article was published in the newspaper's opinion section. Foreign leaders do not usually write in an American newspaper to try to change what the U.S. public thinks. But it happens. Putin said that the anger over Syrian chemical weapons "prompted me to speak directly to the American people and their political leaders." People in the two countries are not talking to each other enough, he said.
A peso is about 8 cents. A liter is a little bigger than a quart. There would be no tax on drinks sold at movie theaters. Alejandro Calvillo works to protect consumer rights. Calvillo applauds the idea of a soda tax. "It's good that there would be a tax," Calvillo said. But he doesn't think the tax Nieto asked for will help. It's too small.
The speech showed that Obama was serious about doing things his way. He gave his yearly State of the Union speech last week. In it the president said that Congress was fighting too much. Congress is made up of people elected to vote on laws. Because of this, President Obama said his second term would be different. He would announce what he would do. Then he would take action without a vote wherever possible. He would use the executive power of the White House.
The famous speech from Shakespeare's "Hamlet" will soon be heard all over the world. A group of actors from London hope to perform the play in every country and territory in the world.

WASHINGTON " Rosa Parks worked hard to give rights to African-Americans. She was arrested in 1955. Back then, the laws were different. Rosa Parks was riding on the bus. There were no other seats. A white man wanted Rosa Parks' seat.
The Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community is helping to lead the return to healthy food. Their large garden is located in Prior Lake, Minnesota. A number of plants in their garden come from heritage seeds. The seeds are also given to other Indian communities. She thinks heritage crops are the foods Native Americans are meant to eat. Such foods kept Native Americans strong and healthy, she said. "I believe our bodies recognize those things." In Minneapolis, the city farmers at Little Earth are far from the wide open spaces of Shakopee.
They are using the hand signal from the movies to ask for more freedom. The army has banned the sign of holding up three fingers. It has arrested young people for using it. Three students were arrested in a movie theater showing "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay " Part 1." "Mockingjay" is based on the "Hunger Games" books. In the books, teens fight against the harsh leadership of the nation Panem. They hold up three fingers to protest against it. The books and the movies are very popular.
He has an email account, but only because he has to. Lynne Joyrich teaches college classes on media. She likes to use phones from the 1950s and 1960s. These old telephones have dials that you have to spin with your fingers. "I keep them because they are very beautiful," she said about her collection of old phones. She does have a smartphone to keep in touch with students. But she often forgets she has it, "for the pleasure of being able to be left alone." The ability to control who can talk to you matters more and more.
SEATTLE " The Chinook tribes greeted Lewis and Clark when the explorers arrived in 1805. The Native Americans brought the explorers food. They helped the explorers find their way. More than 200 years have passed. Now, the Chinook Indian Nation has a constitution.
"It was a shock," said Andrew Young. He is a civil rights leader and was one of King's closest friends. King was 35 years old when he won. He became the second black American to win the peace prize and the youngest. At the time, black children could not go to school with white children. It was against the law for blacks and whites to sit and eat together in public. The prize was not important just for King. It was also important for the city of Atlanta.
There was no other way he could afford a college education. He graduated in 1861. On July 3, 1863, Cushing was commanding a group of soldiers and cannons on the Gettysburg battlefield. Confederate guns killed many men in Cushing's unit. The attack became famous as Pickett's Charge. Cushing was hit twice. He was urged to go get medical help, but he refused to leave the battlefield. "He said ‘No, I'll fight it out or die in the attempt,'" said Kent Masterson Brown.
Instead, it just sits in safe deposit boxes, and gets worn at weddings of course. But the government may not be able to change Indians' love of gold. Previous attempts have failed. Indians believe that gold should mark every stage of life, from birth to marriage to death. One can find furniture, statues and doors made of solid gold. There are gold chain-mail shirts worth millions of dollars. There are even gold-plated iPhones. And to get its Nano car model in the newspapers and on websites a couple of years ago, Tata Motors coated it with $3 million worth of gold and gems.
WASHINGTON " In August, an African-American teenager named Michael Brown was shot. He was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. He was 18 years old. They held protests. They wanted a change in how police treat the people of their town. They held up signs, marched and shouted. They felt Brown's death was not right.
He looked for connections between what he saw. He looked at the force of the tongue when it hits the glass. He compared that with its sticky strength and the amount of tongue slime on the plate. He hoped to find out more about the frogs' amazing sticking talent. Frogs' tongues are sticky, but need pressure to stick. They work similar to sticky tape and Post-it notes. It allows them to stick to a surface and later be removed without a trace. Like tape, the frogs' tongues had more adhesive strength when they hit the plate with more force.
But we're also more aware of God, he said. Obama added, "We're all children of God, we're all made in his image, all worthy of his love and dignity." He said religious violence has "no place in our society." Obama mentioned his recent trip to Vatican City. There he met Pope Francis for the first time. Obama is not Catholic. But, he has said he is inspired by the pope. He praised the pope's work to fight unfairness and to include different types of people in the Catholic Church.
And the passengers just get angrier," said Tao Yuanyong, a Beijing travel agent. This summer new rules were introduced. Planes now can take off whether they already have permission to land or not. Also, airlines can now be punished if they have too many delays. Airlines simply hurry passengers onto planes. Then, planes pull away from the gate, making it look like the flight is on time. But passengers end up waiting hours to take off. Or they end up in flight, circling an airport for a long time.
The bigger battery lets you drive the car more than 200 miles on one charge. Other electric cars can't make it half that far. The automaker made money for the first time at the beginning of the year. Tesla also made more money in the second three months of the year. Tesla made more money than they had expected. Tesla gets special tax rewards every time it sells a car. The rewards are called credits. The credits help the company make money.
If you look a little closer, you will discover something interesting. That is exactly what Stephen Buckley and Jana Jones did recently. Buckley and Jones are scientists and archaeologists. Archaeologists study the humans of the past. They came together to study mummies. They conducted an experiment to learn more about how the ancient Egyptians wrapped mummies. They studied cloth from two of Egypt's oldest cemeteries. The cloths are pieces of fabric that were used to wrap mummies.
Spain is also facing a case of Ebola. Officials there announced that a nurse has Ebola. She was helping care for two priests infected with Ebola and became sick. The nurse is the first person known to have gotten Ebola outside of West Africa. The World Health Organization says more than 3,400 people have died from Ebola since it broke out in West Africa. It is the worst outbreak of the disease on record. >UPDATE: On Oct. 8, Thomas Eric Duncan died at 7:51 a.m. Central Time. He died at the Dallas hospital where he was being treated for Ebola.
Anderson began studying call centers. She found that many of the workers in Mexican call centers grew up in the U.S. Their perfect English made it easy for them to help Americans over the phone. Anderson became more curious. She studied what life was like for people returning to Mexico. Some were teased for their American accents or broken Spanish. Others had trouble fitting in. Landa experienced problems like these in her first months in Tijuana. She also had difficulty finding work.
It took more than 20 years to develop. It cost a lot more than planned. Thirty people died in crashes. The U.S. military used it in Iraq from 2007 to 2009. There was little fighting. Some people in the government called it wasteful. The Marines have been able to use it more widely in Afghanistan. They have been flying it for everything from freight to fighting.
It won't do much. As Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said recently, "Blankets and night-vision goggles are important. But one cannot win a war with blankets." The U.S. and other allies have made weak efforts to stop Putin. Far from it. In fact, Putin has just pushed ahead. After Russia took Crimea, in an unfair election Crimeans voted 95.5 percent to join Russia. U.S. and European leaders called the election illegal.
The portion of Scottish voters who showed up was greater than ever before. The vote brought relief to leaders in London, the capital of the United Kingdom The First Minister of Scotland is Alex Salmond. Independence for Scotland has been his goal for a long time. However, a larger number of voters felt it was safer to stick with the United Kingdom. Salmond accepted the results of the vote. "We know it is a majority for the No campaign," he said. He called on his fellow Scots to accept the results of the vote as well.
Today, the bears are behaving better. Now, hardly any bears damage property or hurt people. In 1998, there were 1,584 reports of damage. There were just 120 last year. Park workers are training bears to stay away from people. More importantly, they are training people to keep food away from bears. "The numbers are down, and that's awesome," said Ryan Leahy. He is a Yosemite bear expert.
People inside the car were the least likely to be hurt during a crash. The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration didn't say if Tesla was right. But the Model S did get a five-star safety rating. Only vehicles that do the best on the crash tests get that rating. It sets vehicle safety standards and makes sure they are followed. Tesla said the NHTSA does not release scores above five-stars to the public. But car makers get an overall score. The score that goes to the car companies can show a rating above five, Tesla said.
But he did it for the wrong reasons. Obama called it a "national security" mission. It is not. Our government protects our national security. True national security issues are caused by the violent actions of humans. It might be war between countries or attacks by extremist groups like al-Qaida. They threaten the lives of Americans. Other types of challenges, such as bad bugs or bad weather, are different.
Four states are already looking to pass laws like Arizona's. McConnell said the laws go after the right problem. But he said it's the wrong solution. A few states do make high school students take a civics test about American government. They ask about the purpose of a democracy. And they quiz students on how to be a good citizen. Some experts say stronger civics classes would be better than just a test. The new rule also comes as part of a larger argument over testing.
ROCK HILL, SOUTH CAROLINA " Fifty-four years ago, nine black South Carolina men were sent to jail. In 1961, they committed a crime by trying to eat in a whites-only restaurant. The men were known as the Friendship 9. In 1961, there were Jim Crow laws in the South. Keeping the two races apart was called segregation. It kept blacks out of many public places that were meant only for whites. Blacks were not allowed to enter many restaurants, hotels and movie theaters. To protest segregation, the Friendship 9 entered a restaurant called McCrory's in Rock Hill, South Carolina.
But with two children, she wasn't allowed. Monroe was a "tomboy" daughter of a carpenter, who built things with wood. She landed a job at the airplane plant. She used a 6.8-pound tool called a rivet hammer. Monroe was just one of many women workers during World War II. She came to represent them all. Monroe became "Rosie the Riveter," symbolizing the hardworking women who built planes. Monroe and her co-workers built 8,685 bomber planes.
Two Canadians and two French citizens were killed, officials of those countries said. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said there were no reports of Americans being killed. Four Americans were reported injured. Kenyatta's own nephew was killed. Military and police helicopters flew over the shopping mall. Meanwhile, ambulances rushed victims to nearby hospitals. The Kenyan soldiers were called in. Kenya's Citizen TV showed victims arriving by ambulance at hospitals, including some who had been shot in the head and others covered in blood but walking.
ATLANTA " Fifty years ago this week, Martin Luther King Jr. won the Nobel Peace Prize. When King won the prize, he was surprised. He later said he thought he was dreaming. It was October 1964. "It was a shock," said Andrew Young.
The charges included spying and stealing. He still could spend a very long time in prison. But the helping the enemy charge was the most serious one. It could have sent him to prison for the rest of his life. It raised an important question: if you are in the army and promise not to tell secret information, is it okay to break the promise if you think the government is doing something wrong? Does the public have right to know the secret information? Manning's leak of secret information was the biggest in U.S. history. He admitted giving more than 700,00 pages of secret papers to the Web site WikiLeaks.
Voters are being asked if these ways of hunting should be banned. A ban would stop them in almost every case. They would only be allowed to protect property, people's safety, or to study bears. "The fact is, you don't need to use these methods to hunt the animals," said Wayne Pacelle of the Humane Society. "Hunting is supposed to give the animals a chance." Pacelle is working with a group called Mainers for Fair Bear Hunting. They are leading the fight to change the hunting rules. On the other side is a group called Save Maine's Bear Hunt.
Trainers should do this if athletes seem like they might hurt themselves or others. And they should call police if a person is acting dangerous. Neal frequently talks to student-athletes about mental health. He wants to make them less ashamed of mental illness. He said it can be very difficult to convince athletes that it's okay to have a mental illness. Athletes try hard to be winners. That can make them ashamed of having a mental illness, said Schwenk. He has studied mental illness in athletes.
"I can't wait for it to affect (Noah's) education plan for the coming year." Game Tested By ADHD Students People with ADHD can have problems paying attention, health officials say. They can be overly active. Government health officials said a record number of children have ADHD. More than 1 in 10 school-aged children have been diagnosed with ADHD. That includes nearly 1 in 5 high-school-age boys. It is not clear why the numbers are up.
Some people think FFA is only about raising farm animals. Audet said it is about much more. Students learn to speak in public in FFA, he said. They also become better leaders. Audet said the classes help prepare the students for life after high school. Twins Julisa and Melisa Velarde are students. They run the school's farm. They happily feed the pigs and cows.
On Oct. 9, gunmen stopped the school bus Malala was riding. They asked the other children to point her out, and fired a bullet into her skull. Two other girls were wounded. The Pakistani government sent Malala to England for treatment. One politician called Malala "a beacon of knowledge." Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari said it was "an attack on all girls in Pakistan, an attack on education, and on all civilized people." The outcry scared the Taliban. They tried to justify their attack on a child.
WASHINGTON " John Lewis is a United States Congress member. When Lewis was young, in the early 1960s, he was not allowed to vote. African-Americans in the South were not treated fairly. They could not vote. Black children could not go to school with white children.
Nunn said he did not think the evidence backed up that thinking. Experts said that it's possible the jury was confused. They may have trouble with what the law says about first-degree murder. First-degree murder means the person had to want to kill the other person. One law in Florida also confuses the general public. The law is called the "stand-your-ground" defense law. The law was a source of conflict during the Zimmerman case. It also came up in Dunn's case, but less so.
It's split into six sections meant to bring in art lovers and pop-culture fans alike. Couches and chairs are placed around the show with headphones. It is designed to allow visitors to relax and watch the cartoons. Some may sit back and take their time. For people who want to learn more, the museum is offering a special pass. The pass allows them to see the show as many times as they want to. It also lets them go to the related movies and talks. One talk will be delivered by Leslie Iwerks, an Academy Award-nominated filmmaker.
He did not answer questions about his use of drugs. In the past, he has said he had not used them since his days as a Texas Ranger. The League says he kept using testosterone and human growth hormone. Athletes take both to try to build muscle. Rodriguez was also punished with the long suspension because he tried to lie and stop baseball from looking into Biogenesis. The suspension could end his career. Government lawyers in Miami said last week that they were looking into Biogenesis. They want to know if the company was selling drugs illegally.
Galvan helps to run the Mission Dolores in San Francisco. His ancestors were converted to Christianity at the missions. He admits Native Americans were treated badly at the missions, but he does not blame Serra. He blames colonialism. They wanted natural resources, like gold and silver. They used Native Americans to get what they wanted. Mistakes were made in the past, Galvan said. "The bottom line is: I believe Junipero Serra was a very good person in a very bad situation, which I call colonialism."
Stores say the law will cost jobs. They would have to get rid of some workers. There is also a worry that the government will collect less money because of the law. Governments take a little bit of money every time something is sold. Sunday is the Christian day of rest. Other Western European countries had rules against shopping on the Christian Sabbath. The rules were put in place after World War II. The Christian Democratic People's Party proposed the law.
WASHINGTON " On Tuesday, some lawmakers put out a troubling report about the CIA. Their report detailed how the CIA questions enemies. The CIA is the U.S. agency that spies on groups and countries. It can do this by sending out spies, or bringing in people for questioning. Lawmakers said the CIA hurt prisoners during interviews in a way that is against the law, such as using violence. The CIA claimed that the harsh questioning saved American lives. However, lawmakers said the CIA couldn't give proof of that.
The wreaths honor those who served in wars during the nation's history. Officials also pushed for more jobs for veterans. "We join as one people to honor a debt we can never fully repay," President Barack Obama said. He was at a ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, which is in Virginia. In New York, Gen. Ann E. Dunwoody led the parade up Fifth Avenue. Dunwoody retired last year. She had been in the army for 37 years. There were 21.2 million military veterans as of 2012 in the United States.
The tribes have their own land. They also have their own nations. They aren't totally under the power of the government. They can make some of their own decisions. The tribes think it's unfair for the government to look into how they run their land, he said.
Paul Williams runs the graveyard. Using goats to clear land is an old custom, he explained. The goats were a bargain. They cost $4,000 for six days of work. It's fun to show how goats can control plants, said Brian Knox. He's the owner of the goats. Goats also mow the lawns outside city buildings in Paris, France. They started last spring.
Using goats is safer than using weed killer. The cemetery is a popular place for dog walking. Weed killer could hurt the dogs. The weed killer chemicals could also end up in the nearby river. They have names like Yoda, Buckaroo and Mimi. The animals were shy at first. They wouldn't leave their trailer. They came out, and ran away from people.
It almost always describes something bad. Kaylie and Tyler are not alone in their struggle to help their mother make enough money to survive. Millions of American adults spend more than half of their income on rent and utility bills. That means one missed paycheck really hurts. That is what happened to Kaylie and Tyler. Their mom could not afford to keep paying her bills, so they had to move. Now the family lives in a small motel room. When they moved Kaylie had to give away her dog, Nala.
"It gives you a glimmer of hope." Pebble Partnership is the name of the company that wants to build the mine. It has not filed for permission to start the work. The EPA may use the Clean Water Act to block the company before it applies for permission. The area of the mine is full of lakes and streams. The sweeping land is surrounded by mountains. Moose, caribou and grizzly bears roam here. A tiny camp dots the Alaskan wilderness.
Every year, monsoon rains shower the region. The monsoons bring life; without them, there would be no crops. But the pounding rains can also be deadly. Google has set up a "person finder" app to help people track down the missing. Jaspal Arya is the disaster minister for the state. He said the rescuers are responding to the flood as if it were a "war." "Forty-five helicopters are combing areas to find people and drop food supplies," Arya said. The roads that would be used to bring relief have been destroyed, he explained.
They also have caused near-riots. Between May and August, there were 26 fights at Chinese airports. One Hong Kong airline has started teaching its workers kung fu. Flights are delayed for one big reason: the growing number of travelers. Since 2003, the number of airline passengers in China has nearly quadrupled. Last year, there were 319 million. Another problem is that the Chinese army controls 80 percent of the skies. And that airspace is reserved for military planes only.
But it helped the world's rich. They made lots of money after the crisis. Rich Americans are especially growing richer. In fact, there are only two places where the rich were not growing richer than the rest of the people in their countries. The report said that in the United States, China and Portugal, the very wealthiest grew their portion of wealth by more than two times. Oxfam is asking countries to take steps so that the inequality doesn't get any worse. It wants countries to be careful with the laws they make. When there is growth and less unfairness, the report said, the rules of business work to help the middle classes and the poor.
What if they can't pay for college? There will be fewer opportunities for them in the military, Byrd said. Fewer young soldiers means fewer people getting college paid for by the military. One study estimated that three out of four young Americans could not join. Many others were kept out by old crimes, unfinished schooling, or credit card debt, the report said. Commanders did not have to be as picky when the military was bigger. They could allow people to join with some of these problems. Fewer new soldiers had completed high school at the height of the war in Iraq.
Kennedy had many health problems, including serious back pain and Addison's disease, which caused physical weakness and yellow skin. JFK took as many as 12 pills at a time to deal with his illnesses. After a speech at the Hilton Hotel in Washington, D.C., Reagan was shot by John Hinckley. He was wounded in the chest and arm. But the White House didn't want to show weakness. Reagan left the hospital after only 13 days even though it took him about seven months to recover fully. Later in his presidency, Reagan sometimes had trouble remembering names and other details. He was in his late 70s.
Its goal is to send 100,000 Mexican students a year to the United States by 2018. Just over 14,000 Mexicans come to the United States on exchange programs today. "I'm convinced this is a way to strengthen our ties," Kerry said. Mexico was once the top location for U.S. students studying in Latin America. Strong family ties and trade exist between the two neighbors. But the numbers have dropped with the spike in drug violence. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto says there is less violence. However, several pockets of violence exist around the country.
The country continues to have great players. The problem is that so many of them do not play in Cuba. To understand the situation, there are a few things you need to know about Cuba's history. From 1953 to 1959, there was a revolution in Cuba. Baseball changed a lot under the new system. The new government banned players from playing outside of Cuba. This was meant to keep baseball talent on the island. In some ways, it had the opposite effect.
But she also leads a parents group. It is asking members to pull their kids out of school next Wednesday in protest. Others across France are doing the same. Teachers and other school workers have called for a national strike. Officials are looking at many ways to fix education. France's quality of education has been falling compared with other countries. They are trying to stop that. Changing the school calendar is just one way.
The local animals have had no time to learn how to avoid the snakes. Doing this would take a very long time. The kingsnake population has exploded on the islands, say U.S. government scientists. The reason is there are no local animals that can control the snakes. But the snakes are very secretive and can change with their surroundings. The kingsnakes are usually found in San Diego, said Robert Fisher. He is a U.S. government scientist. Some of their snakes were sold as pets in the Canary Islands.
Other cities collected less money from their meters. In Orlando, Florida, 15 parking meters gathered just $2,027 in three years. They only made $27 more than what the city spent to put them on the streets. The Pasadena meters did not cost the city money. They were paid for by money that companies gave to the city, Huang said. City leaders say the money collected by the meters might help in finding people homes. The charities have already proven to be very helpful. The number of homeless people in Pasadena has decreased by one-half in the last three years.
On Wednesday, the United States said the two countries will begin fixing their relationship. Cuba is an island less than 100 miles from Florida. The United States cut off contact two years after communist leader Fidel Castro grabbed power. Castro said communism would make everyone equal. At the time, the U.S. government worried about a communist country so close to America. It did not want communism spreading to the United States. The news of beginning to talk again comes after the release of Alan Gross from a Cuban jail. Gross is an American who has been in a Cuban jail for five years.
So far, no bodies have been found. Still, scientists think someone important is buried in the tunnel " perhaps even a king. Sergio Gomez is in charge of the search. "We found very important offerings" outside the rooms, he said. There were many of them, together with other kinds of objects. "These findings are very important," commented Professor George Cowgill. It will take years of study to understand what the objects mean, he added. The people of Teotihuacan did not have a written language.
Daniel Neardea is 5 years old. He lives in Rishon LeZion and just started kindergarten. Daniel recognizes the different sounds of incoming rockets and the Iron Dome. The Iron Dome is the name of Israel's air defense system. Daniel also knows the names of the head of the Israeli army and top Hamas leaders. His mother, Enav Neardea, described the summer as "loud." She said her children got used to the rockets and sirens. "I guess they understand this is part of their lives now."
The Treasury makes it nearly impossible to copy our currency. For example, the $10, $20, $50 and $100 bills all include watermark portraits. A watermark is an image that can be seen in the paper when you hold it up to the light. Investigators say Kellogg tried to copy the watermark. First he printed the front side of the money on one piece of paper. He printed the back of the bill on a separate sheet. Next, he flipped the second paper over and printed a watermark. Then he glued the sheets together.
Those huge pieces just narrowly miss Earth. Some experts worry about radioactive debris. Such bits and pieces would be sent flying after an asteroid exploded. They could cause terrible damage on Earth, experts say. Bong Wie heads the Asteroid Deflection Research Center. He said he is designing a "hypervelocity nuclear interceptor system." Basically, that's a nuclear missile with a battering ram attached. He said the battering ram would separate from the bomb before the bomb hit.
Most of the performers say they're not touring for the money. They have the chance to see a bit of China. They enjoy the companionship of their fellow music lovers. And they have a chance to connect with people who speak a different language and live in a different land. The group stumbled across a music school where an old man was teaching children the erhu. It is a traditional Chinese two-stringed instrument. The Americans watched for half an hour. The kids staged an unplanned concert for them.
He said the Canadian government will continue to work with the U.S. and other countries to fight ISIL. According to people who saw the attack, the gunman carried a rifle. He was also dressed in black with a scarf covering half of his face. The gunman shot and killed the soldier guarding the war memorial. There, he fired many more shots. Inside the building, people protected themselves by hiding and blocking doors with chairs. Some people ran away. Police were outside and did not allow others to come near the building.
The elephants get scared and their ears go out. They make a noise like a trumpet. Workers at the zoo are teaching dogs to act this way, Peet said. Some of the elephants weigh 15,000 pounds each. Peet says the Pittsburgh Zoo knows this. She says it is cruel to both the dogs and elephants. Peet says both in danger. Tracy Gray works for the Pittsburgh Zoo.
The United States and Britain are sending military troops to Africa. They will try to help stop a deadly disease called Ebola. More than 2,000 people in Africa have died since Ebola was discovered in March. The troops will build treatment centers in Liberia and Sierra Leone. However, a health group says Ebola is spreading too fast. Thousands more could catch Ebola, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned. The outbreak, or spread of the disease, began in Guinea. It quickly spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Senegal.
His mission: to help protect Syria's history from the violence of civil war. Daniels taught 20 Syrian people how to protect museums during emergencies. He gave them supplies to protect important pottery and old books. Daniels is a professor at University of Pennsylvania. Daniels said he was amazed at the bravery of the Syrian people. They know their lives are in danger, Daniels said. They feel it is their duty to save the things that are most precious to Syria's history. Syrian rebels have been fighting against the Syrian government for more than three years.
"I never forgot how badly I felt," he said. "I never let it happen again." Lauren Ward's secret to staying awake in class is candy. She snacks on Charleston Chew candy bars at school. "Really, it's usually third period before I start feeling like a human," she said. The group of pediatricians, doctors who treat young people, recommended that schools start at 8:30 a.m. or later. Today, more than 8 out of 10 schools start earlier than that. Most high schools in Chicago start at 8 a.m.
He wrote some harsh things about California's Native Americans. He said they had no place in the Sierra wilderness. Laura Pulido is a professor at USC. "He was a man of his times," she said. They had strong feelings against people of a certain group. Muir worked to disgrace "California Indians by taking their lands." "But he also launched the environmental movement," she said. In Hannibal's view, "what counts is the number of acres protected."
The pharaoh was a king of Egypt long ago. The tomb is the room where he was put after he died. No one knew about this pharaoh before now. Archaeologists study how people lived a long time ago. Bones and old tools are some of the clues they find. The archaeologists think the pharaoh lived more than 3,600 years ago. The tomb was found last week. Sadly, it had been robbed long ago.
Officials will look at Ecuadorian and international law. How can Snowden travel without a valid U.S. passport? Assange told the _New York Times_ that WikiLeaks arranged for Ecuador to give Snowden a special travel document. U.S. officials say they need the telephone and Internet information. They say it has helped stop a lot of big attacks. Assange says the government is guilty of spying -- on everyone. "But it is Edward Snowden who is charged with espionage for tipping us off," he said.
It cannot even be just the "primary" solution. Since World War II, he said, "some of our most costly mistakes" came from "our willingness to rush into military adventures." In those mistakes, the U.S. acted "without thinking." The speech came a day after Obama announced U.S. forces would leave Iraq or Afghanistan. The president did pledge to work with Congress to give more help to groups opposing Syria's government. However, he has decided not to send U.S. troops to Syria. Obama defended that decision. He said there's "terrible suffering" there.
It will make it harder to treat gay people differently. Many states don't allow marriage between men or between women. This is called same-sex marriage. The activists hope the ruling will help them win the right to same-sex marriage. Same-sex marriage is already legal in California. "This is really a very big deal," said Jon W. Davidson. He is with a group that wants equal rights for gay people. In the 2011 case, two drug companies argued about the price of a drug.
Hall has not painted the old way for many years, he says. Instead, he uses the app Procreate. The app lets him paint with his fingers on his iPad. Some artists say that painting on a phone or computer is cheating. Hall does not agree. He thinks being able to erase mistakes easily is a good thing. He says it makes artists more daring. Artists no longer have to worry about expensive mistakes.
In one stretch over 15 hours, the geese went up and down, over and over. But they only climbed about 1 mile over the mountains. It seemed to be difficult. The scientists wondered, why didn't the birds just fly in a straight line? If the birds had flown straight instead of going higher and lower, they would have been more tired. Flying very high makes the birds tired. The air at the top of the mountains is very thin. The birds need thick air to push against their wings.
Kasey Cuenca Torres of San Angelo, Texas, is 9. He got a rousing response to his winning word, phaeton. It is a kind of automobile without a roof. Many of the spellers joked with pronouncer Jacques Bailly. But other spellers seemed in a hurry. They wanted to get straight to their spelling. Some spellers pretended to write their words on their name cards. They wrote invisible words on arms, hands and in the air.
They are laughing so hard they almost knock over their microphones. They get more serious when they play Palestinian hip-hop. They start talking about the war in the Palestinian territory of Gaza. Groups of Israelis and Palestinians have been fighting there. Heads nod in the packed bar to the rhymes of a Palestinian rapper. Shorbaji and Alameh are among several Lebanese graffiti artists and rappers trying to reach young people. Lebanon is in the middle of violence. There is fighting in much of the Middle East.
The class is called "Science With a Sparkle." It teaches girls how to mix their own makeup. "Marie Curie may very well rise from her grave," wrote the blogger Jezebel. Curie was a famous scientist. Right now, few women work in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). Making science more interesting to girls is very important, another blog said. The blog is called Wonkette. It said teaching them about makeup is the wrong way to do that.
Levant is the English term for the region stretching from southern Turkey through Syria to Egypt. ISIL was once part of the al-Qaida terrorist group. Al-Qaida was blamed for the 9/11 attacks in the U.S. Later ISIL broke off from al-Qaida. It has now taken over parts of Iraq and Syria. Recently, the group killed two American journalists in Syria. Videos of the killings shocked the world. "We will hunt down terrorists who threaten our country, wherever they are," Obama declared. He spoke to the nation from the White House Wednesday night.
"This is very obvious what happened," Herbst said. "They landed short of the runway. They were too low for the flight path and the tail of the aircraft hit the sea wall." When approaching the runway, Herbst said, "the nose is pretty high up in the air just before touchdown. Jet fuel in the wings of the 777 then likely caught fire, said Herbst. He flew commercial airliners for 41 years. Last May, Boeing told all the airlines with 777s about a problem. A faulty part was causing an automatic shutdown in the 777's engines.
Studies like this one try to figure out what is going on by looking at a "sample." There are too many people who played football as kids to test all of them. Instead, scientists test a few of them and look for patterns. They hope that these patterns are the same for everyone. This study only tested 42 people. Maybe those 42 people were different in some way. Filley and Bernick suggested that a larger sample group would have given more evidence. Also, all of the players in the study were professional football players.
Two female Democrats lost their Senate seats in the November elections. They were Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana. Democrats and Republicans both belong to political parties. Members of each party share the same ideas about running the government. African-Americans also made gains in the last election. The new Congress has 48 African-American lawmakers. There are 46 in the House and two in the Senate. The number of black lawmakers is up from 43 in the 113th Congress.
Obama will go to Sweden, instead. White House Spokesman Jay Carney said the United States and Russia still work together. They cooperate on Afghanistan, Iran and North Korea. They have worked on a new missile treaty. It was a time called the Cold War since things never heated up into real fighting. Obama was on  the Tonight Show with Jay Leno on Tuesday. He said that Russia sometimes thinks the Cold War is still going on. "What I continually say to them and to President Putin, ‘that's the past.'"
They just cannot afford to care for all the animals. How are dogs chosen? It comes down to supply and demand. Up North, for instance, there aren't enough puppies. Leigh Carter works at HALO Animal Rescue. HALO is based in Arizona. It sent 30 dogs to Idaho on Friday. Already, 12 of them have been adopted.
He cannot read the same way other kids can. He cannot see words. Instead, Richie uses Braille. Braille is a way that blind people can read. The raised bumps stand for letters. Richie loves to read. He likes history books. He enjoys books about the kings and queens of Europe.
Last year, the Delaware and Maryland extensions started a program to help people buy health care. The program is now in 30 states, said Michelle Rodgers. She is the head of the Delaware Extension. Future programs will help make school lunches healthier, Rodgers said. National, state and county governments used to give money equally. That doesn't happen any more. The U.S. government gives less money now. So more cash must come from states, counties and cities.
She says parents are excited. Many people from Mexico grew up listening to mariachi music. Then they moved to the United States. Now their children listen to different music. Mariachi classes can bring families together. Starting a mariachi program is not easy. Many people do not know what mariachi is. They are not used to seeing it in schools.
He admits Native Americans were treated badly at the missions, but he does not blame Serra. He blames colonialism. During colonialism, Spain and other European countries came to North America. They wanted natural resources, like gold and silver. Mistakes were made in the past, Galvan said. "The bottom line is: I believe Junipero Serra was a very good person in a very bad situation, which I call colonialism." There is still a question of how Serra will be remembered. Will he be known for the treatment of Native Americans or as a missionary spreading Christianity in a new land?
Walsh's main goal is to give free clothes to kids. She thinks every child deserves to wear nice clothes. She helps teens. She helps young adults getting their first jobs. Many have come back from war. They have not found jobs yet. Their families have no money to spend on clothes. "We are here to give clothes away to kids who need them," Walsh said.
The Chinook may be able to call themselves a tribe under new rules. The U.S. government is trying to change how it officially identifies a tribe. Recognition is important for tribes. They may get money to educate their children. Recognized tribes are considered independent nations. They can make their own laws. They can govern their territory. Recognized tribes decide who is a member.
"Got to have a job," they say. In the last 15 years, schools in mining towns have lost about 12,000 students. That equals about one in 10 students. It's bad next door in West Virginia, too. The kids that stay travel along mountain roads to the next-closest school. Fences surround empty schools. In Kentucky, fewer students mean less money for schools. The state gives money to schools.
Nowadays, there are many more raccoons than there used to be. This is because raccoons can live on the food people throw away. The problem is that woodrats pick up dried raccoon droppings and take it to their nests. They do this because raccoon droppings often still have seeds and berries in them. There may also be roundworm eggs in them too. Woodrats swallow the eggs, which get into their blood and organs. If the eggs spread to the woodrats' brain, they can kill them. Valent has a plan to stop New Jersey's woodrats from dying off.
So Medina wants immigration law changed soon. The government is split into two parties that often have different political beliefs. One party is the Democrats. They tend to believe it should be easier to come to the United States. Many of them think it should be harder to come live in the United States. Some famous Democrats have dropped by Medina's tent to lend their support. Among them was Vice President Joe Biden. Two Republican members of Congress, Jeff Denham and David Valadao, also came by.
But they said it had some problems. Studies like this one try to figure out what is going on by looking at a "sample." There are too many people who played football as kids to test all of them. Instead, scientists test a few of them and look for patterns. The patterns are not always the same, though. This study only tested 42 people. Maybe those 42 people were different in some way. Filley and Bernick suggested that a larger sample group would have given more evidence.
"My heart bleeds for all the relatives of my crew and our passengers," he said in a tweet Monday. "Nothing is more important to us." Fernandes was born in Malaysia. He went to school in England and later helped run Warner Music in Asia. In 2001, he teamed up with other businessmen to buy a Malaysian airline. At the time, the airline had only two planes. It owed more than $11 million. By agreeing to pay off the airline's debt, they were able to buy the company for just 25 cents.
When he was released, he became a politician. He ran for president in 1998 and won with more than half of the vote. During his presidency, Chavez opened grocery stores that sold food at very cheap prices. He gave health care and education to the poor. That angered many rich and middle-class Venezuelans. Street protests erupted. Chavez was forced out of power in 2002. Two days later the military restored him to power.
It has arrested young people for using it. Three students were arrested in a movie theater showing "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay " Part 1." The day before, five other students were also arrested for using the three-finger sign. "Mockingjay" is based on the "Hunger Games" books. They hold up three fingers to protest against it. The books and the movies are very popular. Thailand was hit by protests in 2013. Some protesters said the government was dishonest and should go.
Their offspring are a mix of the two types. Cuban and American crocodiles are considered separate kinds of animals, or species. The reason is that each has its own set of genes. Genes are the body's instructions. Genes shape how living things look and behave. In humans, for example, there is a gene for red hair. In Cuban crocodiles, there are genes that make them what they are. A species' complete set of genes is called a genome.
The students watched. A small light on Dillen's machine lit up. All at once, the students cheered. The machine is called a solar generator. Dillen was teaching the kids at Tildenville how to build the generators. Imagine you are lost in the desert and your phone runs out of battery power. If you have a solar generator, you can charge your phone and call for help. The class is not just about fun.
Their children go to different schools. There are few places they can even meet and get to know each other. The Palestinians are seeking their own country. They and the Israelis have been negotiating " and fighting " over the land for decades. Most recently, Israel and the Hamas group that governs another Palestinian area called Gaza have been in a fierce fight. Eleven years ago, the Glenview Community Church began Hands of Peace. Glenview is a town north of Chicago. More than 400 Middle Eastern teenagers have participated in the program.
Chris Kemoeatu needed an operation to get a new kidney. He got the kidney from his brother. An operation like that between brothers is not unusual. People have two kidneys, but only need one. What is unusual is that Kemoeatu played football for seven years for the Pittsburgh Steelers. His brother Ma'ake used to play for the Baltimore Ravens. The two teams are bitter rivals. "Everyone jokes about me having a Ravens' kidney," said Chris Kemoeatu.
Susan Marenco wrote the original book. She blamed Mattel for the book's message. Marenco said the problem is that the company still thinks Barbie always has to be nice, that Barbie cannot show anger or frustration. Fiesler, who rewrote the book, is a research student at Georgia Tech University in Atlanta. She also has a law degree, and is a writer. "If Mattel would like to pay me to write a new version, I would be happy to," she said.
Emeruwa says that different audiences may have very different feelings about the play. "I think it'll mean different things to different people," Emeruwa said. It depends on "what sort of situation they're in or what sort of situation their country is in," he said. "Hamlet" is the story of Prince Hamlet of Denmark. He is off studying in Germany. When Hamlet returns home to Denmark, he finds out from a ghost that his uncle has murdered his father, married his mother, and named himself king. Hamlet must decide what to do about this.
NEW YORK " The Girl Scouts have a new patch. The patch reads, "Barbie. Be anything, Do everything." Last year, the Girl Scouts joined with Mattel to start a Barbie program. Mattel makes the Barbie doll.
Hundreds of students and teachers stayed home from school. More than 10 people were arrested for organizing the absences. National school officials have asked for more religious classes. They also want them to start at earlier grades. President Erdogan also wants high school kids to take Ottoman language classes. Ottoman is an older version of Turkish. It was abandoned when Turkey became a modern, new country. Some teachers say the schools are going back to Turkey's tradition.
Scientists now believe there could once have been life on Mars. But they didn't find anything like aliens from the movies. The type of life they found is too small to be seen. NASA's Curiosity rover landed on the Red Planet in August 2012 to look for signs of life. The rover can drive around the planet like a car.
Steel said that most entries came from California. The winner from California was Rose Scott, 12. Her recipe was "Pork and Tofu Lettuce Cups." Tofu is made from soybeans. Tablecloths with stripes in summery colors covered each table. Brightly colored peppers were placed at the center of each table. The children dressed for the occasion. Girls wore dresses with flowers on them.
Sophie's mom has a library card. Jill puts the card number in her laptop. Now Sophie can take the book. Sophie will give the book back later. She can give it back next time they are in the park together. Sophie can even take it to the library. Jill takes the book bike to other parks. Everyone is happy to see it coming.
Natural selection is sometimes called "survival of the fittest." It means that animals that can change will survive. Changes can help the animals hide from their enemies. They can also change to eat different foods or become better at hunting. However, these animals cannot change on their own. They find ways to survive using genes. The genes are inherited from parents. They are like directions for the body.
Unofficial groups also cannot take money from student groups. InterVarsity members say the new rules are unfair. They want their leaders to fit the group's values. In InterVarsity, certain students lead Bible study and prayers. "I don't think a non-Christian would want to be a leader in a Christian group," Cal State student Jasmine Kim said. She still opposed the rule, though. Kim felt that it blocked InterVarsity's rights. The disagreement raises tough questions.
None of the zoo visitors were ever in danger. The breakout happened in the afternoon. It took an hour to get the animals back in. Twelve chimps live in a huge fenced-in area. Zoo workers lured the chimps back with fruit and vegetables. "It was almost their dinnertime," Wisthoff said. Most of the chimps went back quietly. One chimp liked his freedom.
A white man wanted Rosa Parks' seat. Blacks were supposed to move. They had to give up their seats for whites. But she did not want to move. She was arrested. Rosa Parks' courage inspired others. Many people decided to stop riding buses. They wanted to protest the bus rules.
The NRA wants people to be able to own and carry guns. The group called the bill a "historic victory for the Second Amendment." The U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment protects the right to own and carry guns. Americans for Responsible Solutions is an anti-gun group. The group says Georgia has gone gun crazy. It called the bill the most extreme gun bill in the U.S. The group was founded by Gabrielle Giffords. She is the former Arizona congresswoman who was wounded in a 2011 shooting.
They came from several high schools. New teaching rules may soon shape what they learn in their history classes. Students were there to stop that from happening. A new plan was proposed to change history standards. They would be taught more positive lessons about America's history. Fewer lessons would teach information that makes the United States look bad. Most of the young protesters gathered at a busy street corner. They waved signs and American flags.
Many of the people who like video games are women and older people. Some experts had predicted that people would give up on game systems. They blamed free games like Candy Crush Saga. Games are on smartphones. But games on phones and Facebook haven't hurt game system sales. In fact, more people play games now, one expert said. Sony showed off the PlayStation 4 in San Francisco. It is a lot more powerful and runs faster than PlayStation 3.
These are all issues puzzling lawmakers. In Washington, D.C., the Senate's transportation committee tried to understand the possible dangers of driverless cars. They also thought about what rules might be needed nationwide. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is trying to find answers to their questions. It will focus on cyber security, so that drivers don't lose control of their cars. It will also study the possible future of "car communication." Technology may soon allow vehicles to exchange information while driving. The head of the NHTSA said that the new car technology is "breathtaking."
All at once, the students cheered. The machine is called a solar generator. It captures the light of the sun and turns it into electricity. Dillen was teaching the kids at Tildenville how to build the generators. If you have a solar generator, you can charge your phone and call for help. The class is not just about fun. The students will give the generators they build to communities in Africa that do not have electricity. The program was started by Deb Hall.
Arlan Melendez leads the Reno-Sparks Indian Colony in Nevada. He said tribal leaders wanted the government to stop checking into money being made on Indian land. The tribes have their own land. They also have their own nations. They can make some of their own decisions. They can make laws and have their own leaders. The tribes think it's unfair for the government to look into how they run their land, he said.
It still benefits the U.S. military even though the United States no longer owns it. The canal is still a work in progress. Some cargo ships today are too huge to fit through the canal. Panama is expanding the canal. People have been suggesting other shipping shortcuts for a long time. Some have suggested a canal though Nicaragua which is also in Central America. Others thought of a railroad that could carry ships across Panama. Today, one of those plans is back.
Sheep that are resettled are captured with net guns fired out of circling helicopters. Each bighorn is captured individually. It is examined and fitted with a tracking device. Then it is placed in a box and flown to a new herd. Stephenson hopes that bighorns will continue to grow in numbers. Soon, they may once again fill the Sierra Nevada mountains.
The Warhol exhibit is the first special exhibit in its new home. Museum director Hank Hine said the exhibit is appropriate to Dali's memory. The exhibit features some of Warhol's famous silkscreens pictures. They include a red self-portrait taken a year before he died. It uses a woven screen to print a picture. T-shirts and posters are often printed by silkscreening. There are several pictures of Jackie Kennedy Onassis, wife of U.S. President John F. Kennedy. There are a few versions of his Campbell's Soup can paintings.
The day before, five other students were also arrested for using the three-finger sign. "Mockingjay" is based on the "Hunger Games" books. In the books, teens fight against the harsh leadership of the nation Panem. They hold up three fingers to protest against it. Thailand was hit by protests in 2013. Some protesters said the government was dishonest and should go. Others said the officials were elected by the voters and should stay. Thailand's army took over running the country in May 2014.
It said Nigeria's police and army are doing all they can to find the girls. Nigeria welcomes advice and experts from the U.S. Abubaker Shekau is the leader of Boko Haram. He said Boko Haram is responsible for kidnapping the girls. Shekau also warned that Boko Haram will attack more schools and kidnap more girls. The U.S. government said U.S. citizens shouldn't travel to Nigeria.
Students were there to stop that from happening. A new plan was proposed to change history standards. The new standards would try to make students more patriotic and love their country. They would be taught more positive lessons about America's history. Most of the young protesters gathered at a busy street corner. They waved signs and American flags. The demonstration lasted about three hours. Later, about another 75 students walked out of Alameda International High School.
About a million people gathered in the streets of 100 cities in Brazil last week. The mostly young Brazilians were protesting dishonesty and greed by government officials. They demanded that more people share in Brazil's wealth. But they turned bad and two people died. Violence broke out in more than 10 cities late Thursday and early Friday. An 18-year-old man was killed and three people injured when they were hit by a car. The vehicle was trying to drive around a barrier set up by protesters.
There have been many theories. Some people think Earhart simply ran out of fuel and crashed. Others believe she just pretended to disappear. According to that theory, she secretly returned to the U.S. to live under a different name. Expeditions to the island have found tools and possibly pieces of her plane. Andrew Thomas is the editor-in-chief of an airplane safety magazine. Planes are not as advanced as many people might think, he said. Airports and airplanes use old radar technology, instead of modern GPS systems.
WASHINGTON " What did your teachers do before they were teachers? Maybe they flew Black Hawk helicopters. Or they could have served on submarines. More than 15,000 people who served in the military have become teachers. They are part of a military program called Troops to Teachers that helps turn veterans into teachers. The idea is that they already know how to lead. They also learned other things in the military that could be used in a classroom.
She will be starting a new school. Moving is nothing new for Claudia. Her family moves twice a year. Claudia's parents are farmworkers. Farmworkers often move from place to place because different farms need workers at different times. It is called seasonal work. Claudia is not the only one making this journey. This December, thousands of children
Some say it has changed so much that Muir is no longer important. Jon Christensen is a historian at UCLA. He said Muir's ideas are "just not useful anymore." Christensen and others say Muir's thoughts are old. The number of people on the planet is growing fast and humans are changing the environment. Some people have a problem with Muir's biggest idea. He thought nature should be left wild. He wanted people to visit nature while it was still pure.
The DNA maps allow scientists to tell one type of microbe from another. A microbe is a tiny living thing. If microbes can be told apart from each other, disease outbreaks can be stopped faster. The DNA maps will be put online. It has already helped stop serious disease outbreaks. In 2012, scientists found DNA of salmonella in tuna sushi. Salmonella, a type of bacteria, made 258 people sick. The tuna was handled at a factory in India.
The 2011 snowstorm hit on a Sunday night. People woke up the next morning to discover they were snowed in. This one hit in the middle of the day on Tuesday. It left thousands of people stuck at work and at school. There was only one way to prevent the mess. That would have been to warm people ahead of time to just stay home. But no one did that. The 2011 plan never told officials when to warn the public.
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. " Two lawmakers who helped to write Colorado's strict gun laws lost their jobs on Tuesday. John Morse and Angela Giron lost a vote organized by people who don't agree with their rules on guns. Morse and Giron believe there should be strict laws on who can own a gun. So they helped pass new laws for Colorado during the winter. They collected thousands of signatures earlier in the year and organized a special vote. The people of Colorado Springs had to decide whether they wanted Morse and Giron to continue working for them. Such an election is called a recall. Both lawmakers lost.
Cuban and American crocodiles are considered separate kinds of animals, or species. The reason is that each has its own set of genes. Genes are the body's instructions. They are passed down from parent to child. In humans, for example, there is a gene for red hair. In Cuban crocodiles, there are genes that make them what they are. A species' complete set of genes is called a genome. When two different species mate, scientists call it interbreeding.
A Kansas City meadow was the scene of a fierce Civil War battle 150 years ago. Then around 60 years ago, construction crews began building on top of the meadow. Soon, a man began showing up with a metal detector. The man was John Adams Jr. Between 1952 and 1963, he dug up dozens of objects from the meadow. They had been left there during the battle. It is known as the Battle of Westport and it took place in October 1864. It was Kansas City's most important Civil War battle.
Now artists produce them on a computer. Artists working on the upcoming movie "Home" have a challenging job: They have to produce a lot of pictures of three-dimensional soap bubbles. Tiny aliens called the Boov live in the bubbles. Henderson's computer program will be very important for the task. "What we're doing here is creating tools for artists," Henderson said. "I think it's going to be a success." Henderson is only one of many scientists who now work in the movie business. Animation artists rely more and more on people like Henderson.
Not a lot of water, "but we want to save every drop we can." State Parks employees are also deciding which of the garden's plants to save. Franco said they need to figure out what "can survive with very little water." Usually this time of year, Franco said, State Parks brings in "thousands of annuals." They won't be doing that this year, though. State Parks buses are not getting washed, except for their windows. So buses shuttling visitors to the Castle will be a bit dirty. The indoor Roman Pool will remain full, however.
Home-cooked meals are healthier. They also save money. Mrs. Obama spoke at a health meeting in Washington on Friday. Home-cooked meals have less fat and salt than restaurant meals. Too many people think they don't have the time to cook. People also think they aren't good enough cooks. But plenty of meals can be cooked in less than 30 minutes, she said. Growing up, Mrs. Obama said her own mother cooked at home.
They then passed EPAS1 on to their descendants. The reason Tibetans need EPAS1 is simple: Their mountainous home lies about 15,000 feet above sea level. Up there, the air contains about half as much oxygen as is found lower down. Scientists already knew that EPAS1 helped Tibetans do well up in the mountains. Scientists still don't know exactly how EPAS1 works. They do know what happens to people without it when they are high in the mountains, however. In other words, they know what happens to pretty much everyone except Tibetans. The bodies of people without EPAS1 react to the low level of oxygen by producing a lot of red blood cells.
The ANC played a large role in the fight against apartheid. In 1952, he urged others to not follow apartheid laws. Such laws segregated schools. They forbid people of different races from marrying. The government struck back at him. They forbid him from going to gatherings. They also didn't allow him to leave Johannesburg. He was arrested in 1962 for leaving the country without permission and for getting other blacks to protest.
"It's really impossible for them to meet ... back in their home territory," Kanak said. Kanak spoke of the wall that stands between Israel and the Palestinian areas. Other things keep them apart too. Israelis and Palestinians live in different cities. There are few places they can even meet and get to know each other. The Palestinians are seeking their own country. They and the Israelis have been negotiating " and fighting " over the land for decades. Neither side trusts the other.
It helped him take notes in Braille. Richie will go to a bigger contest. He will be in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch Spelling Bee. The winner there will go to the National Spelling Bee. Other kids who are blind have been in the national bee. One was a girl from Oklahoma. She did well at the contest.
Holton Nelson is a cowboy. He is now 15. He has helped herd cattle since he was 4 years old. To herd the cows, Nelson helps guide them where they need to go. Three generations of the Nelson family have herded cattle on horseback. Older brother Nate learned about ranching at college. "But what we're doing, you're not going to learn out of a book." Jade Cole is 16.
Food imports are still being inspected at borders. But any samples that need to be checked could be held up. There aren't as many scientists to check them right now. The CDC also has had to stop monitoring flu. But the disease spreads. It kills about 24,000 Americans a year. It is too early in the flu season for many people to be sick. So there is not a lot to test.
Whoever is willing to pay the most gets the art. Prices are predicted to be high. At least $650 million worth of art is expected to sell. Sotheby's put its pieces on view in London this Thursday. Take Gerhard Richter's red painting "Wall." It's expected to sell for at least $20 million. Andy Warhol's red picture of Chairman Mao is valued at $7 million to $9 million. And then there's a bright red piece by Alberto Burri.
More and more films are shot overseas. As a result, the number of jobs for LA musicians is half what it was five years ago. LA musicians are having a tougher time making a living. Many may soon start looking for work elsewhere. "One of the fantastic things about being a musician in LA is that you're surrounded by" great players, said violinist Marc Sazer. "We have the stars from the whole world" here. "That's going to disappear." Much of the work has gone to Britain.
Suppose the team played eight home games a season. People would go to London to see the games. They would spend money on food, souvenirs and hotels. London businesses might make as much as $165 million more a year. For example, people might buy train tickets to go sight-seeing. In all, British businesses could earn an extra $252 million each football season. Holding the Super Bowl in London could be a problem, however. The hardest thing would be choosing a good kickoff time.
It was 7 feet long. Martin told him that it was against the law to catch it. But the fisherman would not let it go. Martin cut the fisherman's line with a knife. Now, he lets people fight the shark and he takes their pictures. Then he asks them to let the shark go. He gives them a picture to remember their catch.
They say the citizenship test is not enough. Civics isn't being taught very well, some say. In 2010, a test looked at educational progress. Only 1 out of every 7 high school seniors got a passing score in American history. The 2012 elections for Congress had the lowest number of voters in years. The Joe Foss Institute wants to change that. It wants all 50 states to use the U.S. citizenship test for high school students. It wants this to happen by 2017.
Rapamycin may not work on dogs, Austad said. "But if it did, boy, it's going to be huge." The scientists are planning an experiment on dogs. It might not make the dogs live longer, Promislow pointed out. That would be good, too. Finding money for the study may be difficult. The government only pays for studies that help humans. Dog-food companies might be willing to pay for it.
"They could have been nothing more than thieves. Or they could have simply bought the passports on the black market." Another official said there is a list of lost and stolen passports. It is kept by Interpol. It works with the police in many countries. Large international airlines usually check Interpol's list before passengers get on a plane. Passengers on a major airline shouldn't be able to board using a stolen passport, the official said.
Downforce is the downward force created by a moving car. Drafting is the idea that two or more cars move faster when they are lined up one in front of the other. Drag means resistance. Race cars have to push through a lot of air to get around a track. NASCAR wants to show the fun side of engineering and math, said Brent Dewar. He is a top official with NASCAR. Dewar also wants to encourage fans to see NASCAR in a new way. "They love the sport for the sporting element of cars winning, and racing and passing," Dewar said.
They said they were very disappointed in the decision. The family said they know people are upset. They asked people to act "in ways that will make a positive change." The government will look into the Brown case. If they find that police acted wrongly, more police may have to go to court. The government is also looking into the Ferguson Police Department. It is trying to see if the department often treats black people unfairly.
The Nobel Prize is the highest award a scientist can receive. A committee in Sweden votes on who deserves the award. In addition, each winner receives a $1.1 million prize. This year the award in physics went for a discovery of a new lightbulb. It was given to Isamu Akasaki, Hiroshi Amano and Shuji Nakamura.
If necessary, they are suspended. However, some wonder: Are the students who are not suspended learning that what they did is wrong? Or are they just getting away with misbehaving? Howard Zehr is an expert on restorative justice. They learn it when they talk to the students they harmed. Banks said he has begun thinking differently about his future. He said he always thought he would end up in jail. Everyone around him thought that would happen, so he did too.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will not say what "natural" should mean on food labels. But its website says the agency allows the word as long as the food does not have added color, fake flavor or man-made ingredients. According to the lawsuit, Leo paid extra money for the Goldfish snacks. And she believed that the "natural" label meant they had no GMOs. Leo would have chosen cheaper snacks without GMOs. The lawsuit does not say that the Goldfish made her family sick. Pepperidge Farm did not return calls for a comment. The lawsuit just targets the Goldfish.
No marked turtle has turned up in markets where rare animals are sold. These markets break the law by selling rare animals. Many turtles are close to dying out. For many years, they have been hunted. Some people want turtles because they are beautiful and rare. Other people think turtles cure diseases. People will pay thousands of dollars for the rarest turtles. The Conservancy got the ploughshare tortoises in 2008.
Curiosity traveled through space in a rocket. The trip took seven months. It landed on Mars last year. Its mission is to learn about what it is like on Mars. Scientists also are curious if people could explore Mars safely. Curiosity has sent back important information about Mars. The fact that scientists are most excited about? Curiosity has spotted water.
Experts say oil companies may fire thousands of workers. States such as Alaska, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Texas rely on money from oil companies. They get money to let oil companies drill on their land. Now they will get less money. Countries that sell a lot of oil such as Iran, Iraq, Russia and Venezuela rely on money from the oil. Those countries own oil companies. They use the money to pay for their governments. At the moment, many are struggling.
It raises the question of how they were formed." The Spitzer Telescope was sent into space in 2003. It was only expected to keep running for two and half years. More than 10 years later, it's still sending back pictures. More than 600 scientific papers have been published. Indeed, Spitzer has provided enough new information to keep scientists busy for many, many years. "It's done what we wanted it to do," Churchwell said.
The classes are called ag science. The school has 175 students. Almost all of them belong to a group called Future Farmers of America. FFA is a well-known group. It also shows them how to become leaders. About half of Laton's students are still learning English. Most have little money. The students sign up for contests in FFA.
Scientists aren't sure why but they think there are three reasons. One is fishing. The second is that they are losing their habitat. The third is that people around the world want the crabs' blood. The falling number of crabs has led to fewer eggs. And that has led to a big drop in the number of shorebirds that eat these eggs. In Florida, the government is now asking the public for help studying the crabs. Researchers hope this will help them count the crabs and understand their habits.
Next year, the Lake County school district in Florida will open its first health-sciences academy. It has space for 100 students. The programs show what a job in health care is really like. Many TV shows, for instance, do not give a real view. They do not show the many other jobs people do. These include repairing medical equipment or taking X-rays. The special programs offer hands-on experiences to students. They can follow health workers who rush to emergencies.
Or, the whales could have been following a sick leader, Boyd said. Sick whales often head toward shallow waters. They do this to make breathing easier. (Remember: Whales aren't fish, so they can't breathe underwater. But nothing so far is certain, Fougeres said. And "there are cases where we just never know the cause." On average, about 200 whales land on Florida's shores each year. About one "mass stranding" occurs every three years in the state.
"That's not the focus here." The last time the United States sent troops to Africa was in 2011. Obama sent a small group of soldiers to central Africa to help find Joseph Kony. He was the leader of the Lord's Resistance Army. The U.S. troops hunting for Kony are still looking for him. Kony remains on the run.
Before long, public health officials may have a new tool. A British company called Oxitec Ltd. has a mosquito called OX513A. The mosquito's genes have been changed. Genes are the building blocks of a living thing. Some people have a gene that makes them likely to get a disease. Which Has A Death Gene Oxitec mosquitoes are all male. They contain a death gene.
The New York Times, the Guardian and ProPublica all reported on the spying on Monday. They said the spying has been going on for years. The stories were based on documents leaked by Edward Snowden. He used to work for the National Security Agency (NSA). The documents explained all the different ways the U.S. is spying. Millions of people play online games. At one point, about 12 million people were paying to play "World of Warcraft." That is more people than live in Greece.
They challenged a voter-ID law in Texas in August. Holder said the North Carolina law places several "troubling" new rules on voters. It would cut the number of early voting days. People would not be able to sign up to vote and cast their ballot on the same day during early voting. The law was meant to make fewer people vote, he said. The result will be fewer people getting to vote based on their race, Holder said. Several Republican-governed states have passed new voting laws. Republicans argue that the changes are needed.
Big, fancy weddings are also a way of escaping everyday life. "Afghanistan has been at war for 30 years," Rostiyar says. "People spend this much money to get a break from all the misery." Afghanistan got rid of its last king in 1973. Communists, the Taliban, and now the current government have all fought for power. Young people getting married have never experienced peace time in their own country. Abdullah Rahman got engaged a year ago. The father of the woman he was going to marry set the walwar price at $15,000.
Instead, LEDs change energy directly into light. They do not produce heat. LEDs also avoid problems of fluorescent lights, which are long, thin lights. Many offices use them. LED technology now lights our cellphone screens and phone flashlights. Many homes use them as well. Even the twinkling lights put on Christmas trees are LEDs. There also may be more uses in the future.
Now he's threatening Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. Those Baltic countries are our allies. All are members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military alliance. The group is led by the U.S. and Western Europe. What Putin is doing threatens global peace. Only U.S. military aid to Ukraine could possibly stop Putin. So far we've given just non-military aid. It won't do much.
Suniya Luthar is a doctor who studies behavior. She has done research on kids from rich areas. She said just under a fourth of upper middle-class teens think their parents would help them get out of a sticky situation at school. Ethan's court case backs up that thinking, she said. There is another type for the poor. The case sends the message that "you can drink and drive" if your family has money. This is a very, very scary thing to tell our children, she said. Ethan hit and killed 43-year-old Brian Jennings.
The papers, photos and records of a president's work are interesting to historians and all Americans. So where does everything get stored? The answer is at the presidential library. When it is time for a president to leave office, a library is built to preserve his things from the White House that are important to history. They allow people to see the history of American presidents up close. Today, presidential libraries are not just about presidents. The libraries are also about the work and lives of presidents' wives. The wives of American presidents are known as "first ladies."
Scientists showed the evidence at a meeting in Tel Aviv. Early humans collected broken tools made of flint and bone. They used them to make new things, said Ran Barkai. He's an archeologist who helped run the meeting. The objects teach them about the history of humankind. Recycled objects appeared at different times and different places, he said. The way that they were recycled depended on the materials and the surroundings. Archaeologists have found recycled tools around the world.
There are two new Republicans, Joni Ernst of Iowa and Shelly Moore Capito of West Virginia. Two female Democrats lost their Senate seats in the November elections. They were Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana. Democrats and Republicans both belong to political parties. They tend to vote in the same way. African-Americans also made gains in the last election. The new Congress has 48 African-American lawmakers. There are 46 in the House and two in the Senate.
But he also told lawmakers that he was about to ask them to help. He said he wants the government to give teachers the technology they deserve. He also wants to train teachers so that technology can be used in the best way possible. The speech showed that Obama was serious about doing things his way. In it the president said that Congress was fighting too much. Congress is made up of people elected to vote on laws. Because they were fighting, fewer and fewer laws were being passed. Because of this, President Obama said his second term would be different.
He said people of Russian background are being mistreated in those countries too. The Baltic states have been alarmed by such talk. There is now growing fear that Russia may make some move. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are all worried. Russia also claims the Swedes are overreacting. Russia's official government newspaper questioned whether there was any submarine at all. It noted the Swedes hadn't found anything yet. Perhaps, the paper wrote, nervousness is making people see dangers where there aren't any.
The type of bacteria that caused the Justinian Plague is from the same family of bacteria as the Black Plague. Still, the bacteria type that caused the Black Plague is different from the one that caused the Justinian Plague. In fact, the type that caused the Justinian Plague was even deadlier. The scientists believe the type of bacteria that caused the Justinian Plague no longer exists. So what became of this type of bacteria after it killed so many people? Scientists can only guess. Humans may have built up defenses against it. Also, many climate changes happened during the plague outbreak.
The district is putting all school materials online. For Huntsville, HP laptops are the best choice. Schools save money another way. They buy computers without lessons. Teachers in Riverside often use online lessons. Many of them are free. That has saved Riverside a lot of money. Perris school teachers in California make their own lessons on the computer.
Students apply for a scholarship " they ask for it and hope they are lucky. Gray got six of them, but that still wasn't enough. Gray wanted to go to Harvard or another top school. He knew his mother couldn't help him. Gray didn't have a computer at home. For three months he went to the local library to use its computers. He looked for college scholarships to help pay for him to go to school. When he found a good scholarship, he applied for it.
Its suggestions and opinions are taken very seriously. Right now, the United Nations is pushing to help Central Americans who have been coming into the United States illegally. Central Americans are crossing the border into the United States in large numbers, many of them without permission. The United States treats them as migrants. If they are caught entering this country, they are sent back without being able to defend themselves in court. The U.N. says that many Central Americans should no longer be thought of as people looking for jobs. Instead, they should be considered refugees. Refugees are people who have been forced to leave their country because of serious danger.
So, many schools are buying them for the students. The Los Angeles schools are spending $1 billion to buy everyone an iPad. It is one of the most expensive programs in the country. The iPads cost $768 each. The iPads come with new math and English lessons. "Our youth deserve the best we can afford," said John Deasy. He is in charge of the LA schools. Other schools find cheaper ways to provide the latest computers.
But it is also searching for ways to get the Internet to parts of the world without service. "This is a great, big, hard problem," said Richard DeVaul. He is a Google engineer who works on the balloons. Even Google knows the idea sounds a little crazy. But Google did a test in New Zealand earlier this year. Now DeVaul says it could work. Balloons could carry enough wireless equipment to get the Internet to far away parts of Asia, Africa and other places. Now come more tests in California.
The new trees are created by crossing two different types of trees. If the fruit of a new tree seems good, the tree will be saved. If not, it is back to the drawing board. Bedford's sense of what is a good apple and what is not is important. Bedford is one of the best apple breeders in the world, said grower John Jacobson. He is great at spotting the apples people will love. Bedford does not do the job alone. He's been working with Jim Luby for 30 years.
The invasion spread the war to southeastern Ukraine. Before, the war was fought north of Novoazovsk. Some fear that Russia is widening the war. It could push the U.S. and some European countries to stop trading with Russia. The trade blocks are meant to punish Russia for taking over the Ukrainian region of Crimea in March. Russia sees Crimea as part of Russia. Until 1954 it was part of Russia. Over half of the Crimeans consider themselves Russian.
At the end of the day, they break the fast. Families get together for a huge dinner. But an outbreak of violence in Iraq has made this year's Ramadan a difficult time. At a refugee camp, police waved pots and pans to push back dozens of hungry Iraqis. They were rushing to get food to end their first daylong fast of Ramadan. Shouting men scrambled Sunday to reach pots of rice, meat and chicken stew in this dusty, hot refugee camp. It sits near the northern city of Irbil. The city is the capital of Iraq's Kurdish region.
" Walwar is against the law. But officials allow it because it has been a part of Afghan tribal ways for hundreds of years. Punishing fathers or grooms who make walwar payments is rare, Mostafavi says. She said it breaks both Afghan and religious law. Recently, about 400 religious leaders came to Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan,  to oppose walwar. They agreed to argue against the tradition at their mosques. Most Afghans are Muslim and worship in mosques.
He helped write the study. An antibiotic is medicine used to fight off tiny organisms that cause illness. The victims of the Justinian Plague and the Black Plague had similar physical signs. The Black Plague happened 800 years after the Justinian Plague. Did the same type of bacteria cause both diseases? A team of scientists from around the world set out to answer that question. They took DNA from the teeth of two plague victims. DNA holds information about how you look and how your body will work.
The scientists are drilling deep into the Earth. They are drilling down to where earthquakes begin. The scientists are taking samples of rock. They are also measuring conditions down deep. If the scientists are lucky, they will catch an earthquake in action. The Earth's surface is made up of flat plates of rock. Earthquakes erupt when the plates bang against each other. These happen at what are called faults.
They also should wear hats and gloves. Frostbite happens when the skin freezes. It becomes numb and then can get hard. Hypothermia is a dangerous medical condition. Grocery stores in St. Louis sold out of many items. "The problem is the bread is sold out. We're out of milk. We sold out of chips, chicken wings, some meats," Issa Arar of Salama Supermarket said.
Sometimes during that year and the next, she went to school in a dress or skirt. But it did not feel honest. "I would dread taking off my wig," Cassidy said. So, she began taking medicine. She did not tell her mother or ask a doctor. One night, about three months ago, she told her mom. "I was crying," she recalled. Her mom told her she would support her.
One of them was painted by French artist Henri Matisse in 1921. It is called "Odalisque." It is a painting of a half-nude woman. The painting hangs in Amsterdam's Stedelijk Museum. All Dutch museums with art from before the war participated in the review. They have identified the names of 20 people whose art was taken. The people were linked with 61 of the artworks. The museums are trying to find relatives of the former owners.
It has helped children from all around the world. The program lets refugee children stay in America. It places them with foster parents. Ta was clearly a refugee. There are questions about whether children coming to the United States from Central America are actually refugees. Recently there has been a huge increase in Central American children traveling alone to the United States. They leave their countries and travel through Mexico. Then they cross the border to get into the U.S.
They visited Mount Rainier. Students also met members of Native American tribes. The students talked with them about their ideas of nature. Steven Harris is studying earth sciences and anthropology in New York. Harris knows there are not many black men like him who work in conservation. He is not discouraged. "It inspires me," he said. Jordan Morgan is a white student from Minnesota.
The black leaders say this is not enough. They want Holder to look into all cases where police hurt or kill someone. Connie Rice is a a civil rights lawyer in Los Angeles. She said the government will listen to the protesters. Darnell Hunt is with University of California, Los Angeles. He said people have become more aware of the problem. Lieutenant Colonel John Grimpel is with the New York Police Department. Although the grand jury did not charge Pantaleo, the NYPD is still investigating.
But students won't be taught by teachers. Instead, they'll learn by playing computer games. Rasmussen College in Bloomington, Minnesota, offers degrees at campuses and online. The college aims to make money from education, like a business. Last week Rasmussen announced that it will offer courses based on games starting in July. They will be a choice in its two-year degree in business management. Rasmussen calls the program Flex Choice. Officials say the games could make learning more fun.
It is made for an unusual kind of race. Instead of the winner of the race being the fastest car, the race is won by the car that uses the least energy. In other words, the car that uses the least gasoline or electricity will win. Cars that get a lot of miles without using much energy are called energy efficient. They also cause less pollution. The narrow, three-wheeled car is headed to Houston this week. There it will enter the Shell Eco-marathon Americas race. It will face off against 125 other cars.
It probably roamed the Tibetan mountains for several million years. There it ate antelope and other animals. Paleontologist Zhijie Jack Tseng was the leader of the new study of the fossils. He works at New York's American Museum of Natural History. The modern snow leopard is most likely part of the same branch. Both are able to live high in the Tibetan mountains. Big cats present serious problems for paleontologists. They have existed millions of years longer than people have.
The whooping crane is the tallest bird in North America. It is also one the rarest. There are only about 600 birds left. Three were shot in the past few months. They want them to have chicks. The shootings have hurt their plans. The three cranes died. Humans have killed 19 cranes since 2001.
George is now a statue. George lived in the Galápagos Islands. The Galápagos are in South America. The islands are famous. For a long time, George's family of giant tortoises were hunted. Hunters wanted their meat and oil. Nearly all of the tortoises died. George was the only one left.
Some readers are angry that Michael Gove is trying to put Britishness back into schools. Gove is in charge of Britain's education laws. Readers are especially upset about two books. "Of Mice and Men" and "To Kill A Mockingbird" are not on the test's syllabus anymore. "The idea of cutting out American books because they are not British is crazy," said John Carey. He is a professor at Oxford University, a famous British school. Some teachers are worried. They think that not reading these books will narrow their students' horizons.
Now it seems they can take some warming. This is important because sea temperatures are rising. But reefs can only take a little warming. So we have to keep water temperatures from getting too high. Driving a car burns fuel. Heating a house burns fuel. Running a factory burns fuel. All these things put carbon dioxide in the air.
She has to explain to them what different neighborhoods are like. Chen also has to tell them how home buying works in this country. Many of Chen's customers run their own businesses. They are successful in their country. "In Taiwan you can still buy property on a napkin. Here, it's a book full of paperwork," she said. "There's a lot of education I have to do." For Chen, it means a lot of Skype Internet calls in the middle of the night.
Or, did the Chinese kitties come from an Asian type of wildcat? And were they later pushed to move somewhere else? Or maybe they were wiped out? Marshall and her partners will do DNA tests. And it tells cells what to do. DNA is also in plants and animals. Scientists hope DNA tests will clear things up. Until then, experts will wonder what cat is this?
Should kids play tackle football? Football is a rough game. Players get bounced around. Even though they wear helmets, they bang their heads. Some scientists think kids should wait until they turn 12 before they start playing. A new study came out on Wednesday. It was a study of how playing football as a child affects your brain as a grown-up. Scientists first gathered 42 players.
"I feel so happy," Taniya said. "I feel pretty." Willie and Taniya went to a father-daughter dance. At these dances, a girl brings her dad as a date. At the dances, dads show daughters how much they love them. Kelly Fair leads a group called Polished Pebbles. The group teaches young girls about growing up. The girls get advice about school and work.
Many doctors and nurses are afraid of getting Ebola. This fear is keeping many of them away. Too few of them are coming to care for patients, the WHO said. People who come down with Ebola run a fever. The disease can cause kidney and liver failure. There is no cure. Sierra Leone is next to Liberia. A WHO doctor there has become sick with Ebola.
Too many were destroyed by doing that. Scientists did not want to try that way again. Later, scientists tried to X-ray the scrolls. They thought that X-rays might let them read the scrolls without unrolling them. The problem was that the volcano blast had carbonized the papyrus. That means it had turned the papyrus into carbon, a black material like charcoal. The black ink the ancient writers used was made from carbon too. So both the papyrus and ink looked the same when X-rayed.
LONDON " The National Football League (NFL) may soon have a new football team " in London, England. The team would be treated like any other. A new study looked at what a London team could mean. It found that a new team would be very good for British businesses. It could earn them an extra $252 million a year. However, there is one problem: It would be difficult to have a successful Super Bowl in London.
Genes determine things like what color hair you have or how tall you are. Small differences in a person's genes can cause problems. These are called genetic diseases. Amish and Mennonites have an unusual set of genes. Their genes do not mix with the general population. As a result, Amish and Mennonite children are more likely to get certain genetic diseases. The Clinic for Special Children in Strasburg has been studying these rare conditions for the past 25 years. The center was founded by D. Holmes Morton and his wife, Caroline Morton.
They have even set a goal of helping the herd increase from 101 to 130 horses. These horse lovers asked government leaders for more support. The volunteers want to bring several wild horses from another island off North Carolina. These new horses will help Corolla's mustangs have healthier babies. There is still another problem. Some horses cross into the island's wildlife refuge. There are flocks of endangered birds that migrate to the refuge. Nesting sea turtles also live there.
Zanno described her discovery of the first Siats bone. After a week of looking, they had "found nothing," she said. "I was walking across this low badland and stumbled across this sort of black bone. I looked down and saw immediately it was a type of bone from a predatory dinosaur." The scientists spent the rest of their time digging around the bone. They soon realized it was a huge hipbone. But they began to wonder. Maybe they hadn't found a predator.
They can meet other people at the farm with similar stories. The meetings happen at a farmers market that takes place twice a week. The farmers share tips on how to cook with the vegetables they plant and listen to each other's stories. Some 100 families use the farm. Another part of the farm is used by people from the neighborhood. Vegetables grown there are sold at farmers markets. The money they get from the sales help pay for the farm's costs. Families can sell their vegetables at the markets too.
Beaver dams also can flood homes. The government has an idea. It made its own dams. They are like a beaver's dam. If the dams work, beavers can stay where they are.
They clear the water and the shore using boats, nets and trucks. "On a heavy day, we can load up 15 trucks," he said. "Sometimes we get 150 or even 160 tons in a day." The algae is called hutai in China. High levels of chemicals in the water can kickstart the growth. Tim Nelson is a seaweed expert at Seattle Pacific University. He said those chemicals might get stirred up from deeper in the ocean. Or they could be brought by dirt from farms, golf courses and gardens washing into the sea.
Arizona is the first state to make students take the citizenship test. The law was passed on Thursday. A few other states may pass a law like it this year, too. The law is meant to teach Americans who have a poor knowledge of civics. "This has been building for a long time," said Ted McConnell. McConnell works with Sandra Day O'Connor. She used to be a U.S. Supreme Court justice. They work together to increase teaching about government in schools.
People say he once said that the picture could be the work of Leonardo da Vinci. Now Pedretti says he is not sure. Leonardo da Vinci was a famous Italian painter. He also invented many different things. The most famous of his paintings is the Mona Lisa. This painting shows a woman named Isabella D'Este. The police found the painting in a Swiss bank. They were looking for evidence for a case.
It has also been called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). It wants to start its own country under Islamic law. Its fighters have taken over one-third of Syria. Much of northern and western Iraq is also under its control. It was somewhere near the city of Mosul in Iraq. The Islamic State group was fighting Iraq's military. The analysts studied the video for four hours. They found 20 places where Islamic State fighters were dug in with machine guns and other weapons.
The book has been around for more than 500 years. And it's not going away anytime soon. But new technology is slowly taking over. Several digital projects scan in records and books. Anyone with a computer can see them online. These projects are great for students, teachers and lifelong learners, said James H. Billington. He works at the Library of Congress in Washington. It's the country's top library.
In it, Muhammad is crying and holding a sign. It says, "Je suis Charlie" " "I am Charlie." The headline reads, "All is forgiven." Over the years, Charlie Hebdo has stirred up a lot of anger. After the attack, many people in France wore signs that said "Je suis Charlie." They wanted to stand with the dead cartoonists. They also wanted to support freedom of speech, the right to express thoughts and ideas. On Tuesday, staff members from Charlie Hebdo held a meeting.
There are worries about the kids' safety. They are teenagers in the United States without their parents. "There's so much money that can be made," said Jay Chen. He is president of a school board in California. They won't try to help students. Instead, they will try to make money. Most foreign students still study at private high schools. There were 62,000 foreign students in U.S. private schools last year.
"Hunting is supposed to give the animals a chance." Pacelle is working with a group called Mainers for Fair Bear Hunting. They are leading the fight to change the hunting rules. On the other side is a group called Save Maine's Bear Hunt. The group has a lot of supporters. Maine's wildlife department even supports it. It says that Maine has more than 30,000 black bears. "We have one of the largest bear populations in the country, certainly on the East Coast," said James Cody.
The conversation lasted 90 minutes. He expressed his "deep concern" about the situation, the White House said. Obama said that Russia was breaking international law. John Kerry is the U.S. Secretary of State. Kerry spoke about the Crimea situation on Sunday. He said the U.S. may not go to the G-8 summit. It is a meeting between eight of the richest countries in the world. This year it is to be held in June in Sochi, Russia.
People worry that being overweight would hurt Christie's chances of becoming president. Our country is obsessed with weight. Many people are trying to shed their extra pounds. An overweight person running for president would draw a lot of unwanted attention. They would point out that being overweight can cause many illnesses. Others would feel that an overweight person just does not look like a "real" president. They might not want to pick him or her for that reason alone. Christie will not say exactly how much he has lost.
Like Winfield, many of these graduates were the first in their family to attend college. They may feel pressure to be successful. They may also need to help support their family. All of this makes it very important for them to find jobs. Black college graduates may not know people who can help them find jobs. More importantly, employers may treat them unfairly because they are black. Employers are more likely to offer a job to a white person, Schmitt said. More than twice as many white graduates found jobs than black graduates.
Another deadly attack had happened only two days earlier. A man killed one soldier and injured another with his car. He was shot to death by police. The man was already being watched by police who thought he was dangerous. After the shootings, officials canceled two events in Toronto. They were honoring a teenager from Pakistan named Malala Yousafzai who won the Nobel Peace Prize. In 2012, she was shot in the head by a dangerous group in Pakistan because she supported education for girls. The government was also going to make her an honorary citizen of Canada.
"It's just sad to think that somebody is out there protecting our country," said Dennison Winchell. He is the principal of the school. "At home, their kids are going to a school with great teachers, but with awful" buildings. The repairs needed at Branch will cost nearly $28 million. However, the school district, Muroc Joint Unified, would have to pay $5.5 million. The district does not have the money, said Trevor Walker. He is with Muroc Joint Unified. "We've tried pretty much anything we can think of," Walker said.
In the mid-1980s, scientists were trying to understand HIV. The HIV virus causes AIDS, a deadly disease. Since humans and chimps are closely related, scientists infected chimps with HIV. The researchers hoped doing so would lead to a cure. But only one got an AIDS-like disease, and died. Chimps don't react to infection the same way humans do. Scientists developed a vaccine for HIV, but it only protected chimps, not people. An article in the British Medical Journal wrote: "When it comes to testing HIV vaccines, only humans will do."
The pair also met with Cuban musicians. Rubio and people who support the ban say these trips give money to the Cuban government. The government restricts the Cuban people's freedom. That's why Rubio and others even want to limit family visits to the island. "Every day has to be chock-full of approved activities, pretty much from 9 to 5," Popper said. "Not everybody wants to travel that way," he admitted. But, Popper said, Beyonce and Jay-Z's trip helped Cuban travel. It made Americans aware that they can visit Cuba legally.
With the cutbacks, the military is looking for the same successful people that everyone else is chasing. Byrd would know: he leads a high school's young officer training program in Missouri. It's expensive to find soldiers, he added. "We don't have the flexibility we once had to get it wrong with one kid and hope the next one works out." Military cuts are part of that effort. Congress set limits on military spending last December. The Army could shrink to its smallest active-duty size since before World War II. It could still shrink more in the future if the government says so, say military leaders.
The Yazidis fled fighters of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Levant is the English term for the region stretching from southern Turket through Syria to Egypt. The group has also been called the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). ISIL has taken over huge chunks of land in Iraq and the nearby country of Syria. People under their rule must obey their laws. ISIL fighters captured the Yazidi city of Sinjar. Tens of thousands of Yazidis escaped to Mount Sinjar. Iraqi Yazidis could die in large numbers, President Barack Obama said.
Pooh changed owners a few times. He finally ended up at the library in New York in 1987. He has been there ever since. He and his friends are in a special Children's Corner. They think that Pooh should return to England. After all, that is where Pooh is from. Some people even want to build a Winnie-the-Pooh museum. Pooh and the other animals could live there.
The group is also trying to make it easier for students to continue their education in Mexico. Los Otros Dreamers formed a couple of years ago with the help of Jill Anderson. She is an American professor doing work in Mexico City. Anderson became interested in people like Landa when she noticed something strange about a call center near her house. If your Internet doesn't work, for example, you can call a phone number. Someone from a call center will answer and help you with the problem. The person who answers could be anywhere in the world. Many American companies set up call centers in other countries to save money.
First they were broken. Next, the pieces were shaped into tools. Then they were lost or left somewhere, found by someone else, and reworked to be used again, he said. Early humans used axes and flint to shape tools. The tiny flakes that flew off the stone were made into small tools. Gopher and Barkai found flint chips between 200,000 and 420,000 years old in a cave. They had been turned into small blades. The cavemen cut meat with them.
They are known as World Heritage sites. Five of those have been damaged in the war, said a new report. Richard Leventhal runs the Cultural Heritage Center at the University of Pennsylvania. He works with Brian Daniels. Cultural heritage is the common history that a group of people share. It can tell us who we are and where we come from. If important heritage sites are destroyed, people can lose their identity, Leventhal said. Daniels compares the situation in Syria to a home that is on fire.
The kids won a healthy recipe contest called the Healthy Lunchtime Challenge. More than 1,300 children between the ages of 8 and 12 entered. The 54 winners were invited to dinner at the White House. A winner was selected from every state. President Barack Obama was not invited to the event. But that did not stop him from making a surprise visit. Once he was in the East Room, he joked that he usually gets invited to events in his own house. The president also told the crowd that he's "not a great cook."
The United States and Europe are angry at Russia. They say Russia broke international law. They are trying to pressure Russia into leaving Crimea. They have stopped bank accounts of Russian officials. U.S. and Europe have threatened more punishments. Putin said the U.S. and Europe are threatening Russia. And he said Russia will react. But he promised that Russia will not fight against Western countries.
You'd jump into a pile of straw or climb on top of haystacks. Who doesn't like that? It's all about fun activities involving farming." Agritainment is big business on small family farms. The idea is to turn agriculture into entertainment for non-farming folks. Few activities are more popular than corn mazes. The attraction also brings in big money. Family farms are struggling right now, says Kamille Combs.
"But I hate what the Russian government is doing throughout the world." Russia is doing several things that has angered the U.S. government. One is that it has been helping the president of Syria, Bashar al-Assad. Assad is battling rebels who are trying to get rid of him. Russia has been giving weapons to Assad. Another is that the Russians have let Edward Snowden stay in their country. Snowden is an American who gave away secrets about how the U.S. government spies on people in the country and overseas. The U.S. government wants to arrest Snowden, but Russia has refused to hand him over.
WASHINGTON " Traditional stamp collectors do not like Harry Potter and Bugs Bunny. At least not on their stamps. Some stamp collectors have a problem with newer U.S. stamps. They say the committee that picks the stamps is focusing on the wrong things: pop stars and fictional characters. They say stamps used to celebrate important people and events. But things are changing. Ken Martin is head of the American Philatelic Society. The group is made up of stamp collectors.
The children mostly come from countries such as El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. Most of these students are determined, Coughlin says. "They are also very scared because they don't have certainty for their future here," he says. America's schools are one of the few places where the children are sure to get help. While they wait, most of these children live with family members. They must go to school. Schools and districts in cities such as Washington, Houston and Miami have seen an increase in the number of these students. They expect more to come this fall.
QINGDAO, China " There's one easy way to make the beach even better for Li Lejun. Just add seaweed. Hundreds and hundreds of tons of it. The 7-year-old boy from Beijing was having the time of his life. His legs were buried in the sand on the beach covered by seaweed. Men nearby were using pitchforks to throw seaweed into a yellow front-end loader. In the other direction, a backhoe was scooping it into dump trucks.
She thinks new kinds of milk drinks need to be created. She said flavored milk might help. She also likes the idea of making milk-based sports drinks. Massey said milk companies have to understand what people look for when they choose a drink. They may want a small, easy-to-carry container. "We can't just put a gallon of milk on a shelf and hope someone buys it," she said. Milk companies are trying to get children to drink more milk. They are guessing that funny containers might help.
A huge group of glaciers in Antarctica is melting. There is no way to stop it, scientists say. That could give scientists time to protect people from rising sea levels. Scientists thought the glaciers in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet would last for thousands of years. But new studies discovered they are melting. And it's happening quicker than scientists thought.
He did it, Mooney said, in an "understandable, and even moving, way." The original U.N. report has 19 main points. For each of these, Johnson wrote a haiku. Take global warming's effects on ice and snow. And that is causing ice in the Arctic to melt. The report spends more than 100 pages on that subject. But Johnson boils it down to 17 syllables: _Glaciers and ice sheets
They are piloted by computers on board. They can also be flown by a person on the ground. Drones are like an eye in the sky. People use drones to take pictures of sports events. They also can take pictures of people without them knowing. A lot of people don't like that. Recently, people also began using drones to make videos. YouTube is filled with videos of beautiful scenery taken with drones.
Chafe said the concert was possible for two reasons. First, Stanford's Internet connection is very fast. Second, the music was slow. Other kinds of music would be more difficult to play. Thirty years ago, no one dreamed "we'd be where we are," said Godfrey. "Now we are trying go beyond where we are," he said. Godfrey's team hopes "to truly bring the whole world together."
She was hurt. She cannot walk. Daniela is now 15. She goes to school near Chicago in Illinois. The kids in class are from many countries. They also had problems. This fall, they wrote their stories. The stories went in a big book.
More than half said they were "dark." The rest described themselves as "cinnamon," "chocolate," "brown," "yellow," "a little tanned" or "black." Arriagada flipped through Clase Magazine. Its pages were filled with photos of wealthy families celebrating social events. "Look," he said of the people in the magazine, "it's like Norway."
The last time people were buying so little milk was in 1982. Experts say there are three reasons why milk is not selling very well. They say one reason is that people's shopping and eating habits have changed. Another reason is that there are so many new drink choices. There are also new sports drinks. A third reason is that milk has not changed. Some say new kinds of milk drinks should be offered. Americans still buy as many gallons of drinks a year as they used to.
ORLANDO, Fla. " A bunch of Coyotes will be let loose in hurricanes this year. Their mission: to improve our understanding of hurricanes. They are small pilotless planes called drones. The Coyotes were developed after Hurricane Sandy. This hurricane season will be the first time they've been tested. The tiny planes will be launched into the eye, or center, of hurricanes.
They would be able to play with each other as if they were in the same room. Their computers would link them. Right now, that's not really possible. There are big problems when musicians in far-apart places try to perform together online. Playing together is very difficult. So musicians are excited by a new effort to make sending music notes much faster. The plan is to make them so fast that they approach light speed. Light travels at about 186,000 miles a second.
A 9.0 earthquake there created a huge tsunami that flooded coastal areas. That tsunami took people by surprise. It killed more than 10,000 and left more than 300,000 homeless. It also damaged a nuclear power plant. Researchers hope to save lives by quickly spotting tsunamis. They have installed tsunami detectors deep under the ocean. Predicting a tsunami's strength is important to saving lives. Japanese scientists did not realize how big their tsunami was.
People also can't be treated unfairly if they are from another country. For 50 years, the unit has solved problems between the races in American cities. In St. Louis, mediators have been in and out of the city for years. Adolphus Pruitt is the president of the St. Louis branch of the National He said he has called police officials many times about a problem. Sometimes they respond, but more often they don't. When the peacemakers get involved, Pruitt said, everyone is willing to talk. Two Sundays after Michael Brown's shooting, mediator Rita Valenciano called a morning meeting of nine community leaders.
In the new book, Barbie says, "Really good games are made by a team of people. I'm doing some of the coding now, but Steven and Brian are helping, too." Coding means writing computer code. Computer engineers, or software engineers, write code to build websites, apps and games. She got 50,000 visits to her website in just a few days. Before that, she only had 800. Mattel is the company that makes Barbie dolls and other Barbie products. It apologized for the book and stopped selling it.
They knew what to look for. The Clinic for Special Children in Strasburg studies the genes of the Amish and Mennonites. Doctors there learn which genetic diseases are common for these groups. Genes are the code, or "blueprint," of who a person is. Small differences in a person's genes can cause problems. These are called genetic diseases. Amish and Mennonites have an unusual set of genes. This is because they marry only within their communities.
Some medical research could still be allowed under the new plan. But Fish and Wildlife said such research will be limited. Only studies that help the chimpanzee species will be allowed. People have argued about using chimps in science for years. New technologies are helping researchers. Once, the only way to learn certain knowledge was to test a live animal. Now that same knowledge can be learned in a test tube. In addition, more and more evidence shows that chimpanzees don't work as well as human models in research.
More than half of those students were athletes. Sports are very important at many schools, including UNC. Athletes are only allowed to play as long as they get good grades. These schools often want to help their athletes in many ways. But the classes that did not exist went too far. Now UNC has found itself in deep trouble. The fake classes scam went like this: Counselors encouraged athletes to take certain classes in the African and Afro-American Studies department (AFAM).
They can "walk alongside the whales." Or they can watch the whales swim underwater. People can even see them from above. SeaWorld will also study orcas in the ocean. The scientists will watch over SeaWorld's orcas. They will see if the orcas are happy. But PETA is unhappy. PETA a group that wants to protect animals.
"But my family still lives on our (ancestral) land." The Chinook may be able to call themselves a tribe under new rules. The U.S. government is trying to change how it officially identifies a tribe. Recognition is important for tribes. They also get services like health care. Recognized tribes are considered independent nations. They can make their own laws. They can govern their territory.
Since 2010, Boko Haram is believed to have killed at least 300 students. Boko Haram can be translated as "Western education is forbidden." The group is against girls going to school. It said it kidnapped the girls because they should be married rather than go to school. The girls' kidnapping sparked anger around the world. People began a Twitter hashtag campaign, #bringbackourgirls. First lady Michelle Obama participated in the Twitter campaign. In the last week, it has lost some of its popularity.
! [](. teenager managed to sneak onto a flight to Hawaii over the weekend. He climbed over the fence at the airport and into the wheel well of a plane. The wheel well is the place where the wheels are kept while the plane is in the air. Now, airports around the country are worried. They think the boy's trip could say something about how safe and secure American airports really are. If a teenager could hop over a fence and onto a plane, why couldn't a terrorist? There have been many airport break-ins in the past few years.
Less than two weeks before his surgery, Christie appeared on "The Late Show." Comedian David Letterman asked Christie if his jokes about the governor's weight bothered him. The governor then pulled the donut out of his pocket. He took a bite. The audience laughed. Christie said his size was "fair game." He added, "I'm basically the healthiest fat guy you've ever seen in your life." The next day, former White House doctor Connie Mariano told CNN that she worries about his "dying in office."
The group works with young men to help them understand what causes violence and how to stop it. The group's work inspired VanBuren. She teamed up with Toews and they started to offer restorative justice courses in jails. The class they teach helps prisoners understand how to use the shape of buildings to think about their crimes. There were 18 men in the class this summer. One of them was tall man named Anthony Pratt. He designed a new prison building. His design had a large room with a skylight to let the sun in.
Maybe you can watch some matches at your local movie theater. With a huge screen, great sound and other fans, the atmosphere could be exciting. Do you prefer pro wrestling or mixed martial arts fighting? You could soon see your favorite stars battling on the big screen.
"It's hard to let the girls do everything," said Mohammad Tamim Hamkar. He runs the scouting program. Leaders say the Afghan girls make great scouts. That's because the girls don't have many chances to do things in Afghanistan. Girls feel strong wearing a Scout uniform, said Keith Blackey. He is American; he is helping the Scouts. Shy girls change when they put on the uniform. It's like a superhero wearing a cape, he said.
Families living in expensive areas can have more money than $23,624 but still be poor. Officially, almost 46 million Americans are counted as poor. The new numbers show there are more, almost 48 million poor people. Thirteen states and the District of Columbia found there are more poor people when they used the new numbers. In 26 other states, the number of poor people went down. The numbers show how much the different programs help. They calculate how many people in each state would be poor if they did not get help from the programs. School lunch programs also helped keep children from poverty.
Can't make it to Brazil for the 2014 World Cup? Maybe you can watch some matches at your local movie theater. With a huge screen, great sound and other fans, the atmosphere could be exciting. Do you prefer pro wrestling or mixed martial arts fighting? Movie theater owners hope to show more than movies in their theaters. Tim Warner is the head of a movie theater company called Cinemark with many theaters in the U.S. and Latin America. He had never heard of the British TV show "Dr. Who."
The program wants to stop bullying. It gives students fun ways to include others during lunchtime. It makes sure no one eats alone, said Laura Talmus. She began Beyond Differences. Talmus' daughter was named Lili Smith. She had a hard time in middle school. The bones of her face did not grow normally. She did not look like other kids.
WASHINGTON " The U.S. government is deciding whether to allow a 1,700-mile oil pipeline that would stretch from Canada to the Gulf Coast of the United States. Native Americans in South Dakota don't want it near tribal lands. They say they'll fight the Keystone XL pipeline. Faith Spotted Eagle figures that building a pipeline would only bring crime and dirty water. But, she doubts that Native Americans will get the U.S. government to block the project.
As a result, some players leave Cuba with dreams of making more money. Many start playing in the United States and Canada, commonly known as the major leagues. As players leave, the talent level of the Cuban league goes down. This is sad for Cuban baseball fans. In fact, baseball is the official sport of Cuba. The country continues to have great players. The problem is that so many of them do not play in Cuba. To understand the situation, there are a few things you need to know about Cuba's history.
They could hit a plane or get sucked into a jet's engine. The FAA outlaws the use of drones by most businesses. But the rules are often ignored. Farmers use drones to check their crops. "So far we've been lucky," said Rory Kay. He is a pilot and expert in air safety. He said luck won't prevent a crash. The FAA only allows drones to fly below 400 feet.
The California bullet train authority said Musk's plan is worth considering. But authority Chairman Dan Richard also said Musk would have things to worry about if he went forward. He would be building the project across earthquake zones. He would have to protect environmental areas and animals. People are already critical of the plan. They say the design is unusual. It has not been examined by outside experts. They question if the money Musk talks about makes sense.
It also will help them learn to read. She gave a startling fact. At least half of Philadelphia's adults are known as "low literate." That's half a million people. Cooking is "science, it's math, it's literacy. And it's fun," Reardon said. She said a lot of people who don't read well don't go to the library. They worry they don't read well enough.
It seems to be working. There are more planes and animals around. But there are fewer accidents. Osmek traps and moves many birds. Some birds are killed. Their bodies go to the Burke Museum for classes to study. Seattle is the first airport with bird radar. The system is better now than when it started.
The cost of the testing varies. Home kits are $99 but hospital tests can cost thousands of dollars. The price also changes depending on which disease the doctor is testing for. Some experts believe that the home tests are not very useful. Doctors say these tests can help to find the best medicines. One woman had a disease that was not getting better with her regular medicine. But with genetic tests the doctors found a medicine that worked. But for healthy people, there is little point in having these tests.
ROZSYPNE, Ukraine " On Thursday, a Malaysia Airlines jetliner was shot down over Ukraine. On Friday, world leaders called for a stop to the fighting in eastern Ukraine. The area is near the Russian border. The Ukrainian government is fighting rebels. The pro-Russia rebels are trying to separate from Ukraine. The rebels are from eastern Ukraine. Many there consider themselves to be Russian and speak Russian.
"We need new stuff," Damian said. He is a sixth-grader at Irving L. Branch Elementary School. The school is on the Edwards Air Face Base in California. It does not just need new stuff, as Damian said. School officials would like to replace the roof. They would like to buy new playground Air conditioning and better lights are also on their list. Branch is one of 10 California schools on military bases in terrible condition.
The Internet was just developing back then. Today, he said, most artists use a digital device in some way when they make art. But there are some drawbacks to tablet art, Hatch added. Oil paint has a "certain almost magical quality." This is lost when a painting becomes "a piece of code" on a screen, he said. In any case, Hockney isn't giving up painting or drawing any time soon. And he also doesn't plan on giving up tablets. When asked where he sees the art world going, he shrugged his shoulders.
The programs give students the skills to get these new jobs, he said. Students get time in school to study for exams for licenses. If they pass, they can work as technicians and medical assistants right after high school. Some programs allow students to earn an associate degree. Students still can study something else if they change their minds. No one expects teens to have made all their decisions yet, said Barkley of UCF.
The large property stood near a river crossing known as Byram's Ford. Then the war arrived. The Adams family had to flee. It did not return to the Byram's Ford property until 1870. George showed Smith two shells. They were the type fired by guns used by some Union soldiers. Smith had a copy of the same type of shell. But here were two real examples.
The center was founded by D. Holmes Morton and his wife, Caroline Morton. D. Holmes Morton was working at a hospital in 1988. One day, a 6-year-old Amish boy named Danny Lapp came in. He had brain damage and could not use his arms or legs. Morton identified Danny's disease as glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1). GA1 is a rare genetic disease that attacks the brain. At the time, there were only eight known cases of GA1. The Lapp case changed Morton's life.
The cave paintings are important for many reasons. They are a collection of very old Buddhist art. They also show what life was like long ago in China, on the Silk Road. The Silk Road was the long path traders took between Europe and Asia. They learned about very old Chinese clothing and dance. They learned about musical instruments and sports. They even discovered an old sport called "elephant lifting." The caves also contain many religious sculptures.
He's not far off: Less than 1 percent of new technology companies are started by a Latino. Silicon Valley is the center of the technology industry. One-quarter of the people who live there are Hispanic. So the fact that there are few Latinos trying to start tech companies does not seem to make sense. It's called an "incubator." Just as an incubator on a farm keeps eggs warm until they are ready to hatch, Avila's business helps new Latino businesses get up and running. The incubator is ready to debut. The first seven startups begin "class" this week.
There's a lot of crackling." Kalapana was once home to a famous black sand beach and a historic Hawaiian village. It is now a perfect example of pahoehoe. There are two main kinds of lava: pahoehoe and aa. She said aa lava is sharp and broken. The pahoehoe that covers the beach here could be shown in a museum. There are many types of lava, Babb said. Today, Kapalana is lovely in its own way, Hauanio said.
They note that college sports programs make billions of dollars a year. But student players don't get any of that money. Scholarships sometimes aren't even enough to live on for a full year, they claim. A decision by the NLRB could come soon.
Eshel is a scientist. "You can still have bacon and eggs and whatever you want. As long as it's not beef, you have made a significant step forward," Eshel added. He said the study should change people's choices at the grocery store. The second study looked at farms raising cows for beef around the world. The results showed a huge increase in harmful gases linked to animals raised for meat. Poorer countries saw huge increases in greenhouse gases. They increased the amount of greenhouse gases by more than half from 1961 to 2010.
Still, the caves survived. Today the caves are facing a new danger: tourists. A million tourists will visit the caves this year. They want to see the caves, to learn about them. They carry large backpacks. Their hot breath is not good for the paintings. Chinese and American scientists have been working together to protect the caves for more than 20 years. They made a long-term plan to protect these caves.
He seemed nervous. The police felt that something was not right. Later, they raided the apartment in Munich where the man lived. His name is Cornelius Gurlitt, 80. Cornelius got the art from him. The stunning find was reported Sunday by the German magazine Focus. It is one of the largest collections of stolen art, says Julian Radcliffe. He tracks works of art that have vanished.
Cuba said he brought cellphones and computers into Cuba, which is against the law. Gross, who is 65 years old, has already been sent home. Cuba and the United States spoke secretly for a year about freeing him. Gross' family in Maryland said he is in bad health. In Cuba, he had refused medical care, food and visits from American officials. He was protesting being kept in jail. The United States made a deal with Cuba. Gross will be released.
In the tent classroom, there were toys and stuffed animals for younger children. The classroom also had some children's English books. The teachers told the children a fairy tale. "It's not really a school, it's more of an entertainment," Hanadi said. They teach children between ages 5 and 15. "We are giving them the basics, letters and numbers," the 23-year-old Hanadi said. "We mostly try to bring some joy into their lives. They've seen too much bloodshed."
As he takes the test, he reads something written by Thomas Jefferson. The student might agree with Jefferson about how important freedom is. This could make the student less likely to agree with the Chinese government. The College Board, the company that makes the SAT, admits that the new test includes American ideas. The U.S. Constitution, for example, says that citizens should be allowed to freely say things against their government. This is not an idea that the Chinese government agrees with. China's government has many rules about what its people can and cannot do. The government also tries to control what citizens say and think.
It is much faster than the president expected it to be. At first, White House officials thought the FCC would not be allowed to spend money right away. Usually it must wait. But the FCC recently decided it could give the money to schools faster. The faster timeline comes without a single vote from the rest of the government. Obama has had problems in getting some members of the government to agree on plans in the past. Obama added that the plan will not push the United States to spend more than it has planned for the year. But he also told lawmakers that he was about to ask them to help.
Farmers say some scenes in the video may have been mistaken for animal cruelty. They suggest Mercy for Animals might be promoting its own cause. The animal-rights group supports a vegan diet. Vegans don't eat animal products. John Rosenow is a Buffalo County dairy farmer. He says large farms might have a disabled animal once a month. Workers on his farm use heavy equipment to move a downed cow. The animal is placed on a soft bed of sawdust.
WASHINGTON " A state dinner at the White House is a fancy affair. They are usually held in honor of kings, queens and presidents from other countries. But on Tuesday night, the White House hosted one just for kids. The young guests walked into the White House as a harp played. Tables filled the room so guests could be seated for an eight-course meal. Waiters dressed in tuxedos served food on gold-rimmed plates. First lady Michelle Obama hosted the meal. It was less formal.
NASHVILLE, Tenn. " Players hitting wives or girlfriends is a serious problem in big-time American sports. Many people also feel that the players who do it are not punished enough. Recently, Ravens running back Ray Rice hit his girlfriend. After hitting her so hard that he knocked her out, he was punished. He is not being sent to jail. His only punishment is that he cannot play for two games this year. Meanwhile, Browns wide receiver Josh Gordon was punished much more harshly for a less violent crime.
Their case went all the way to the Supreme Court. The court decided that just because Myriad found the genes does not mean it could control them. The judges said the company should not have been given the patents. Many businesses and scientists were watching the case. Having the patents helped Myriad earn a lot of money. Myriad could charge more to screen for the genes since no other company could offer the same test. Lawyer Sandra S. Park represented the scientists who sued. "We are thrilled," Park said.
Some of the subjects are famous. Most are not. They are the unknown faces of war. World War II was a war fought against Germany and Japan. George Edwards is a 94-year-old veteran who knows what it means to fight. Sometimes fighting takes courage, like the battle in Italy that fractured his spine. Sometimes it takes discipline, like the march across the Arizona desert in training camp. And sometimes it takes creativity.
More than 10 years later, he is still at it. It might be hard to imagine why these kids would want to be in a writing class. One reason they take the class is that they miss out on  regular school. Writing classes help them learn, grow and discover themselves. Writing lets them express feelings like anger and guilt in a healthy way. For example, Budnick had one class read a newspaper article about a man named Steven Czifra. He spent years behind bars as a youth. Now, Czifra is a college student at the University of California in Berkeley.
And in the past good penmanship, or handwriting, was important. But we now live in the digital age. People use computers and smartphones more and more. Handwriting often is not needed. This set of classes is known as the [Common Core](. Core). Penmanship classes were dropped from the list. But seven states have changed their mind. They are now bringing back cursive.
She nows employs more than 3,000 women. The Nigerian Adenike Ogunlesi is famous for her "Ruff 'n' Tumble" clothing line for children. She first ran her business out of a car trunk. Women starting businesses can help poor countries, experts say. It is common to borrow money to start a business, then pay the money back when the business has become successful. But because these women are so poor, no bank will let them borrow money. According to the World Bank, women business owners could use $300 billion to grow their businesses, but no one will lend it to them. To address this problem, the World Bank has started a $600 million fund to support female business owners.
It then processes them " treats and prepares them for use " back in China. African countries end up making less money than they might otherwise. What's more, they learn nothing about processing materials themselves. In addition, Chinese companies in Africa rarely hire African workers. The United States wants to do things differently, Obama said. It won't be about removing "minerals from the ground" to benefit the United States, Obama said. The goal is to increase "jobs and opportunity for all our peoples." U.S. companies in Africa don't behave like Chinese companies, said Africa expert Witney Schneidman.
Not only that, the tightrope was not flat. It curved as it went up. Mathematicians measure steepness with angles. A 0-degree angle is a flat line. Wallenda said that his tightrope went upward at a 19-degree angle. A class of 10th- and 11th-grade math students at Hinsdale South High School near Chicago took a look at Wallenda's numbers. Some of the numbers did not add up. The mystery began on Monday, the day after Wallenda set his record.
The study was published Monday. Scientists studied 1,000 students in grades 10 through 12. Some kids went to good schools. Some went to bad schools. Most of the teens were Hispanic. They lived in poor neighborhoods. The scientists made an important discovery. The kids in good schools made better health choices.
LOS ANGELES " About 252 million years ago, before there were even dinosaurs, most of the living things on Earth died. Scientists called this event the end-Permian extinction. It has long been a mystery what caused it. A new study blames tiny microbes on the bottom of the ocean. Microbes are small living things that can only be seen through a microscope. The microbes in the new study are so small, about 1 billion of them could fit in a thimble-full of ocean dirt. But they were almost responsible for killing off all the life on our planet, the scientists suggest.
Southern California's Lake Mission Viejo is certainly beautiful. However, it is also very wasteful. The huge lake is man-made. The lake was built during the 1970s. First, an enormous hole was dug. Then, the hole was filled with 1.2 billion gallons of water. Every year, the lake needs to be partly refilled.
In 1998, there were 59,918 nests. In 2007, there were 28,074 nests. In 2012, there were 58,172 nests. This year, there are 46,885 nests. "We do not know why the numbers went down. And we do not know why they are coming back," she said. In the early 2000s, many turtles were being killed. Some scientists blamed fishing companies.
The programs show what a job in health care is really like. Many TV shows, for instance, do not give a real view. They mostly feature doctors. They do not show the many other jobs people do. The special programs offer hands-on experiences to students. They can follow health workers who rush to emergencies. They can practice stitching up chicken legs. They can also help out at hospitals.
Its nickname is "Hurricane Hunter." It's called that because the WP-3 Orion helps scientists study the powerful storms. Between Oct. 21 and Nov. 6, Hurricane Hunter went on eight flights over the Arctic. The Arctic is located in the northernmost part of Earth. Nick Bond is a scientist at the University of Washington. He rode on Hurricane Hunter during its first Arctic flight. Bond and other scientists studied ice in the cold Arctic seas. But the scientists aren't studying cold air.
Imagine this: Your head aches and your nose is stuffed up. Just getting out of bed is hard. You visit your doctor, and within minutes he knows exactly which virus or bacteria is making you sick. This allows him to give you the right medicine right away. First, he uses something like a Q-tip. He rubs it inside your mouth. Then he places it in a tiny box. A few minutes later, he knows what's giving you the sniffles.
Groups who want to keep the ban went to the country's highest court, the Supreme Court of the United States. They asked the Supreme Court to stop Judge Granade's order. On Monday, the Supreme Court said it would not stop Granade's order. Gay people in Alabama may now get married. It made others very angry. It also split the state's judges into two groups. State probate judges are in charge of issuing marriage licences. Some said they would obey Granade.
At that point, very few bighorns were left. They lived in just one area: Wheeler Ridge. The herd there became the "source population" for recovery efforts in the 1970s and 1980s. In other words, sheep were taken from Wheeler Ridge and brought to various other areas. Now, four source herds are being used to build new herds. These are large enough to lose several animals at a time. Female sheep only give birth to one lamb a year. That means the growth of herds is slow.
California has had little rain for three years now. There are also fears that the climate is changing. The world's population is growing too. People will need much more food in the future. It became clear that technology and farming could help each other. For example, the company Blue River Technology has created a machine for farmers. The machine can cut lettuce 100 times faster than people. These machines can take over the work of humans.
The highlight of their honeymoon was supposed to be a visit to Yosemite National Park. But the park was closed. In fact, all the National Parks are shut. So are many other services run by the government. Republicans are using the spending plan as a way to delay President Barack Obama's health care law. The fight has disappointed many tourists like Cogan and Mohally. "We grew up seeing pictures of it in books," said Cogan, a 31-year-old receptionist. "You know, the cars underneath those huge sequoia trees.
The new ruling could change that. It may make it very difficult to stop others from using the name as well. Sports teams make a lot of money from selling team-related clothing. The Redskins stand to lose much of that money if anybody can use their name. If it came up with another name, that name could be protected. The Redskins aren't ready to give up yet, though. The team quickly announced it will fight the new ruling. It may be years before a final decision is made.
In fact, baseball is the official sport of Cuba. The country continues to have great players. The problem is that so many of them do not play in Cuba. To understand the situation, there are a few things you need to know about Cuba's history. The fighters took over the government and set up a new kind of country. Baseball changed a lot under the new system. The new government banned players from playing outside of Cuba. This was meant to keep baseball talent on the island.
It may be wiped out. We will likely never see it again, says a new study. The study explores the mystery of the missing strain of bacteria. This strain jumped from rodents to humans. Then it just disappeared. New and just as deadly strains could appear just as mysteriously, the study said. "Fortunately, we now have antibiotics that could effectively be used to treat plague," said Dave Wagner. He helped write the study.
Turkey is also one of the United States' closest friends in the region. Turkey is larger than the state of Texas. Istanbul is a very modern city, but other parts of Turkey are less developed. Around 99 percent of Turks have a Muslim background. Turkey's leader is Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Some people feel that Erdogan has tried to force religious laws onto the people. This is just one reason for the protests against him. The first protests were over a very popular park.
Concussions are slight brain injuries that come from getting hit in the head. Recently, many people have become worried about concussions in children. In particular, they worry about children who play football or hockey. On Wednesday, the White House announced several new efforts to fight concussions. The goal is to prevent and treat concussions in children.
In 1999, the Millers wrote a report filed with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Corps is a government agency that tries to prevent disasters. It warned back then that someday there might be a large mudslide on the hill. "We've known it would happen at some point," he said. "We just didn't know when." Daniel Miller knows the hill's history. He has collected reports going back to the 1950s. He has folders stuffed with maps, slides and drawings.
But it's different in Wyoming. A high school graduate can get a good salary. The energy business is big in Wyoming. Most of the state's money comes from coal, gas and uranium. You have to go after those jobs while you can, said Mark Perry. He's an economist at the University of Michigan. He studies the energy business. He thinks the oil boom will last for a long time.
Governors and mayors across the area said people should get emergency supplies. They also asked that people check on elderly and disabled neighbors. They could be in danger. Mayor de Blasio urged New Yorkers not to drive. "We need to prepare," de Blasio said. The storm could be "worse than we've seen before." Officials in Hoboken, New Jersey, were also preparing. They were expecting up to 30 inches of snow and heavy winds.
They also imagine videos that don't freeze. Musicians could do much with faster speeds. Players in Hawaii and Antarctica could perform together perfectly. A group of computers linked is called a network. They can be words, pictures or sounds. Signals travel the Internet about 10 times slower than the speed of light. Often, they are 100 times slower. Godfrey hopes to figure out just what is slowing them down.
The scientists were looking for clues that might show when the ancient Egyptians started to make mummies . They used microscopes to look at the small pieces of fabric. Bits of bone and skin were stuck to the cloth. Buckley and Jones were surprised by what they found. They were from plants, animals and natural petroleum. The chemicals are not usually found on cloth as old as the cloth the scientists looked at. They believe the chemicals were spread on the cloth before a mummy was wrapped. The chemicals would help protect the body after it was buried.
The tanker was shipping oil for the company Exxon Mobil. When it crashed, the tanker spilled at least 11 million gallons of oil into the waters of the sound. At the time, it was the nation's largest oil spill. Andy Wills was laying on a friend's couch in Cordova, Alaska, on March 24, 1989. He was a fisherman in Prince William Sound. "My buddy had just handed me a cup of coffee in the morning," Wills said. "And there's the Exxon Valdez on TV, spilling oil." He added, "We were like, ‘No!'
"There's a lack of tolerance here," said Elisheva Mazya. She runs a nonprofit called New Spirit. It works to keep nonreligious young people living in Jerusalem by helping them get jobs and pay for houses. For years, many nonreligious young people have been leaving the city. The young people also don't like the religious rules. There is a lot of anger against the ultra-Orthodox throughout Israel. More than half of all ultra-Orthodox men study at religious schools. They do not work.
Austin Mann is one of the 12 artists Apple invited. He used an iPhone 6 to take photos of a glacier in Iceland. Mann takes many of his pictures with his iPhone. He likes the way taking pictures with an iPhone is so cheap and easy. It also changes how they work. Roz Hall is another of Apple's 12 featured artists. New technology has certainly meant big changes for him. Hall once did his paintings the old way, with real paint brushes.
They had met with school Superintendent Dan McMinimee. Students were not happy with what he had to say about the new plan. The plan was suggested by school board member Julie Williams. She is a conservative, meaning that she supports traditional ideas. They believe that reading such material will change students' thinking. Students, they fear, will become rebellious. They will no longer feel proud of their country. Williams' plan was created because of a change in how history is taught in schools across the country.
All you have to do is stay calm and float along with the flow. Experts are now deciding whether or not to change the advice given swimmers. Some feel people should still be told to swim parallel to shore. Others feel they should be told to float and wait. In a handful of cases, swimmers would be forced into deeper water. No one knows right now if the experts' advice will change. Meanwhile, beachgoers should keep a simple tip in mind: If you spot a rip current, play it safe. Swim near a lifeguard or don't go in the water past your knees.
He said the case changes history. Dominguez is a lawyer with an animal rights group. His group filed the court case for Sandra. It said that she had been denied her freedom for no reason. Sandra was born in Germany in 1986. She has lived at the Buenos Aires Zoo for 20 years. Now the courts will try to find another home for Sandra. She is getting older, so she will have to be healthy enough to travel to be moved.
They also need someone to encourage them to work hard. Otherwise, they might not stick with college. So New Haven started another program called College Summit. The goal is to create a "culture of success," but not just in high school. Students, teachers and parents must all be on the same page. They must all expect that every student can and will attend college. The high schools now have "college readiness" courses for their students. New Haven Promise is giving parents classes about how to apply to college.
Millions of birds migrate in September to October and in February to March. That is when the conservationists are trying to create temporary wetlands. Bird flight paths have been carefully studied. The information is used to put wetlands where they will do the most good. This week, farmer Jon Munger is hard at work. He is getting the fields ready for another flooding. As he works, various birds stand around, waiting for the fields to fill up with water. In two weeks, there will be thousands of birds.
Her death lead to the campaign on energy drinks. The two drinks she drank had as much caffeine as 14 cans of soda. That's five times the daily limit doctors say teens should drink. Monster Beverage has repeatedly denied any link between its drink and Fournier's death. It showed nearly 21,000 people went to the emergency room because of energy drinks in 2011. That is twice as many people as in 2007. About 1,500 of those visits were by children aged 12 to 17. Doctors tend to agree that energy drinks are unsafe for minors.
Doctors in these hospitals have to work by candlelight. Without lights their jobs are very difficult. Hall was excited by the solar suitcases. She wanted to show them to her college students. She and her students soon built five solar suitcases. When they were complete, four were sent to Haiti, Costa Rica, Guatemala and Kenya. Hall kept one to use in demonstrations. Then, about three years ago, Hall began visiting Tildenville Elementary School.
His 20-foot-long painting "Gassed" shows soldiers marching blind. A gas attack had burned their eyes. Soldiers returned home injured and in shock. Writer Gertrude Stein called these soldiers a "lost generation." The war had badly hurt all of them. Writer Ernest Hemingway's short story "Soldier's Home" tells of a man named Krebs. He returns from the war and finds that no one in his community wants to hear what really happened over there. "Krebs found that to be listened to at all he had to lie," Hemingway wrote.
Instead, it uses sensors to record a piano player's hand movements as tiny bits of information. Those bits of information are called data. Once they're recorded, they can be sent over the Internet. Then, other pianos thousands of miles away can play back the music almost exactly as the first piano player played it. Russian pianist Osip Nikiforov, 19, is recording a classical song on the Disklavier. But if you played what he is recording, you would not hear anything. He is recording his movements. "These pianos are fantastic teaching tools," said Nikiforov.
Brown started out in the energy business. To him, fake meat is about more than health. It is also a way to limit harmful gases that come from animals. Some of these gases are believed to cause climate change. And it may be hard to provide enough meat for everybody by the middle of the century. Fake meat can help, he thinks. Janet Corvin, 52, has been a vegetarian since she was a child. She doesn't eat meat.
"What should we have done?" the prime minister asked. "Kneeled down in front of these people and asked them to please remove their banners?" Erdogan believes the protests were organized by a foreign country to damage Turkey. The U.N. and U.S. government told Turkey to respect the protesters' rights. Caitlin Hayden is a spokeswoman for the U.S. National Security Council. Hayden said that she is "concerned by any attempts to punish" people for "exercising their right to free speech." U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon called for the government and the protesters to talk to each other to resolve the dispute.
There had been a dangerous battle the night before. But that was nothing the people in her village weren't used to. Their village had been a center of violence since the Afghan war began. She picked up something that looked like a rock. Shah Bibi threw it on the ground and it exploded. The explosion killed Shah Bibi's brother. It took off most of her right arm, destroyed her eye and scarred her face. A group called Children of War Foundation wanted to help her.
The FAA said that 7,500 drones may have a license to fly by 2018. Other groups say the number of drones flying around the country will be much higher. Some say 160,000 drones will be sold every year by 2020. For now, the number of drones used to sell homes is small. MRIS is a company that puts together lists of thousands of houses and buildings that are being sold. It found out that only a very small number of agents used drones to sell properties. But more agents are thinking about using them. The drones could make buying and selling homes easier, said Andrew Strauch.
U.S. officials are looking at whether this could be terrorism. In any plane crash they look for signs of terrorism. Two passengers on board used stolen passports. Passports are travel papers. An official working to fight terrorism said stolen passports are not a sure sign of terrorism. The official said there was no proof of terrorism so far. FBI agents will review video of the airport in Kuala Lumpur. They'll look for pictures of passengers at the ticket counter and other areas.
