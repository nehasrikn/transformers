His dog, Silver, is 11 years old. His other dog, Frisbee, is still playful like a puppy. At 10, though, she also is old for a dog. Promislow wants to find a way to make pets live longer. Experiments show it can make mice live longer. It can also delay some diseases. Promislaw hopes it will work for dogs. No one has tested to see if rapamycin makes people live longer.
After the decisions, angry crowds gathered around the country. The protesters say the men would not have been killed if they had been white. They also believe each officer should have been charged with a crime. "Black lives matter!" Black leaders have listened to the rage and the pain of their words. They hope the protesters will begin a new civil rights movement. They also demand that the government investigate if police uses too much force. "They're asking for something simple.
Al Sharpton is one of the leaders. He is the head of the National Action Network. "Marches and boycotts led to the '64 Civil Rights Act," Sharpton said. Sharpton said that the Civil Rights Act led to change 50 years ago. Today, though, change is still needed, he said. Those pushing for change have the attention of top leaders. President Barack Obama is the first black American president. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Junior, who leads the Justice Department, is black.
For example, cafeteria lunches had much more fruit than packed lunches. They also had more vegetables and meat. In other words, home-packed lunches were missing a lot of important food groups. What did they include instead? Average packed lunches for elementary school students included large amounts of sugary drinks. They also included chips and dessert. Cafeteria lunches do not come with these treats. Sugary drinks, chips and dessert are not served in most schools.
Cafeteria lunches do not come with these treats. Sugary drinks, chips and dessert are not served in most schools. Children's nutrition is an important topic. More American children are overweight than ever before. The meals that children are eating could be a big cause of the problem. Much of the cheapest and tastiest food these days is also the unhealthiest. That is why there are rules about what kind of food cafeterias can serve. Students might love it if a cafeteria served pizza every day, but it would not be healthy.
BERKELEY, Calif. " People around the country are raising their voices in protest. They are chanting sayings like "Hands Up! Don't Shoot!" And for the first time in years, protesters are also singing songs that express their anger and pain. Grand juries in New York and Missouri decided not to indict, or charge, white police officers in the deaths of two black men. A grand jury is made up of a group of citizens. They decide if a person should be formerly accused of a crime. If the grand jury had decided to charge the officers, they would have had to defend themselves in court.
Don't Shoot!" And for the first time in years, protesters are also singing songs that express their anger and pain. In the last few weeks, protests have broken out across the country. Grand juries in New York and Missouri decided not to indict, or charge, white police officers in the deaths of two black men. They decide if a person should be formerly accused of a crime. If the grand jury had decided to charge the officers, they would have had to defend themselves in court. Instead, the grand juries decided to not charge the officers. Protest songs have not been heard in the U.S. since the 1960s.

The capsule was found in bricks from the Massachusetts State House. It was put there in 1795. America's famous patriots Samuel Adams and Paul Revere were there. Paul Revere made a famous horseback ride in 1775. "It's exciting," Bill Galvin said. He is a Massachusetts official. "The history of Massachusetts is the history of America," he said. Workers found the box while they were trying to fix a water leak.
The process is known as crossbreeding. It took Currie 12 years of growing peppers before he finally took the world record. He tested hundreds of combinations before he found one that was hot enough. A year ago, Guinness World Records officially called the Carolina Reaper the hottest pepper in the world. It's named after Wilbur Scoville. He was an American pharmacist who invented the scale in 1912. Non-spicy peppers like bell peppers have 0 Scoville heat units (SHUs). Spicy jalape√±os might reach 10,000 SHUs.
Even after the jobs ended, the teenagers did fewer violent crimes. There were 1,634 teens who wanted to take part in the study. Only 730 were chosen. The scientists looked at the number of arrests by the teens in the study. One thing did not improve. The amount of crimes that were not violent did not go down for the teens with jobs. Sara Heller was in charge of the study. She is a college professor.
They also learned how to control their moods and act like adults. Some of these skills may have helped keep them out of serious trouble. The teens in the study also had an adult to help them out. The adult was a mentor. The Chicago program was called One Summer Plus. The teens in the program were paid $8.25 for every hour that they worked. They worked 25 hours each week. One Summer Plus lasted a shorter time than other job programs.
Jobs might be one way to make the world a little bit safer. A new program in Chicago found jobs for some teenagers. Then a study showed that if teens have jobs, the number of violent crimes they do may go down. So they picked teenagers. Then they gave each one a job for eight weeks. While they were working, the teens were arrested for violent crimes fewer times than teenagers who did not work. It was not just because they were too busy working to get in trouble.
They worked 25 hours each week. One Summer Plus lasted a shorter time than other job programs. It also cost less money. Heller said it was too soon to know if the program was a good use of money. They will need to see if they find jobs and how long they work. Teens in the study held many different kinds of jobs. They helped at day-camps, cleaned up Chicago, planted gardens and worked in offices. The jobs were not always exciting.
That is Elizabeth II. The world's best-selling author of all time is a British woman. She is mystery writer Agatha Christie. J.K. Rowling is the best-selling author of recent memory. Yet no woman has been chosen to be put on British money. "It's another instance of women's contributions being wiped out," Criado-Perez said. This month, dozens of protesters dressed up as famous women in British history. They gathered outside the Bank of England's headquarters in central London.
Not everybody is happy about it, especially women. Starting in 2016, Churchill's face will appear on the back of the 5-pound note. The bill is worth about $7.50. It is the most widely used note in Britain. Churchill was the prime minister who led the country as it battled Nazi Germany in World War II. The bank called him "a hero of the entire free world." But the decision has made thousands of British women angry. Men are upset, too.
They climbed to get over a high peak and then sailed down when the ground dropped. They did extra work to keep flying over mountains, over and over again. In one stretch over 15 hours, the geese went up and down, over and over. But they only climbed about 1 mile over the mountains. The scientists wondered, why didn't the birds just fly in a straight line? The scientists realized that it was the best way to travel. If the birds had flown straight instead of going higher and lower, they would have been more tired. Flying very high makes the birds tired.
Some birds in Asia zoom up and down across some of the world's tallest mountains. Just like a roller coaster. Scientists studied the birds, called bar-headed geese. They were on their way south for the winter. The scientists followed the birds across the world's tallest mountains. They found that the geese do not fly in a straight line. The birds fly up, down and around, much like how a roller coaster moves, following the shape of the mountains. Every winter, the bar-headed geese leave Mongolia, a country between China and Russia.
They burrow in soil and logs. Scientists do not know much about them. In 2010, scientists took videos of a red fox. It was seen at Sonora Pass. It is north of Yosemite. The video showed the fox biting on a bag. The bag had chicken scraps. Later, scientists checked the bag.
A red fox was just seen in Yosemite National Park. It was the first time in almost 100 years. California protects 14 animals. The red fox is one of them. Scientists set up video cameras at Yosemite. The cameras took pictures of the fox in December and January. The pictures might be of the same fox. Scientists do not yet know.
They are also trying to find the bodies of the people who died. Whatever they find, like a skeleton, will be sent to a laboratory. There, experts will closely study the body parts to figure out who that person was. If they do find out, his family will be told. He is with the U.S. Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command. The command is in charge of finding missing and dead military members. POW stands for "prisoner of war" and MIA stands for "missing in action." Berg says that searchers also look for things that belonged to the men on the aircraft.
If they do find out, his family will be told. The man in charge of the search for bodies is Gregory Berg. He is with the U.S. Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command. The command is in charge of finding missing and dead military members. Berg says that searchers also look for things that belonged to the men on the aircraft. For example, they would collect "a journal or dog tags (military ID) or clothing items that may have the name in it." Things like that help them to figure out who people were. Beckstead showed items found last year: navigation tables and a small stove.
It did not mean they were for the attacks. Many people living outside Paris said they understood how they felt. "People were killed in the housing projects by police, and there was no minute of silence for them," said Aly Sacko. He is a Muslim. He lives in a banlieue where two teenagers were killed in 2005. They were running from police in the projects and were electrocuted in the train station. Their deaths set off protests across the country. The government's new plan is to work with schools.
People blew these outside the hospital. It was deafening. Mandela helped to end laws in South Africa that separated people by the color of their skin. White people ruled South Africa. Mandela didn't agree with the rules. He was locked up in prison for 27 years by the government. In the country's first election in which everyone could vote, Mandela became South Africa's first black president in 1994. On June 8 Mandela was taken to the hospital.
Mandela helped to end laws in South Africa that separated people by the color of their skin. White people ruled South Africa. Black people were not allowed to vote or own a home. Mandela didn't agree with the rules. In the country's first election in which everyone could vote, Mandela became South Africa's first black president in 1994. On June 8 Mandela was taken to the hospital. He has been very ill since then. People have brought gifts.
She also said that he might be able to return home soon. Mandela's family celebrated his birthday with him inside the hospital. South African President Jacob Zuma visited the national hero on Thursday morning. The people of South Africa love and respect Mandela. Zuma said that "Madiba remains in hospital" but his health is improving. Many people were glad to hear this. The president wished Mandela a joyous 95th birthday. Zuma thanked the people for supporting Mandela through his illness.
Every July 18 is known as Mandela Day to celebrate his life. Mandela became ill in June. He is being treated in the hospital for a lung infection. South Africans arrived outside to let him know how much they care. In South Africa, you can't go far without hearing a vuvuzela, a noisy horn. People blew these outside the hospital. It was deafening. Mandela helped to end laws in South Africa that separated people by the color of their skin.
The poisons get into fish. Then the sea lions eat the fish. There also may be too many sea lions and not enough food. California sea lions used to be hunted for their fur and a special kind of fat called blubber. In 1972, the government protected sea lions. Hunting them became against the law. The numbers of sea lions grew, Johnson said. There are now about 300,000 sea lions.
Jobs are out there. That's not the problem. Businesses just can't find workers with the skills they need. The jobs go unfilled. Education and worker training are the problem. If nothing changes, it will get worse. By 2018, there will be 5 million jobs with no one to do them. We won't have enough skilled workers to keep up with the needs of businesses.
Workers usually live on or near the farms. Their housing is provided by the farm owners. Things have been getting better over the past few weeks. Some of the biggest farms have given workers new toilets and beds. Now, things may improve even more. Last week, many of Mexico's largest farms said they would work together to improve working conditions. Wal-Mart also announced it would try to make things better. Experts said Wal-Mart is an important company.
Wal-Mart already has inspectors who visit farms. The inspectors give talks on how Wal-Mart wants farmworkers to be treated. Wal-Mart's approach has not worked well, however. One problem is that it is not always easy to get to the places where the workers live. Another problem is that farm owners are not always truthful. "You basically see what they choose to show you," said farming expert Devon Zagory. He said the inspectors are asking the farm owners "where their worst secrets are." Often, the farm owners simply hide problems, Zagory said.
The farms are located all over Mexico. Another problem is that farm owners are not always truthful. "You basically see what they choose to show you," said farming expert Devon Zagory. He said the inspectors are asking the farm owners "where their worst secrets are." It is possible to find out how workers are being treated. Inspectors can make surprise visits. They can talk to the workers. But it takes longer and costs more to do things that way, experts said.
They do not believe the bureau is doing this to help the horses. Horse supporters say that the agency is really helping ranchers. The ranchers own cattle and sheep that eat grass on the land. The BLM is in charge of huge areas of land across the United States. Nine of the BLM's 16 summer roundups will happen in Nevada. The agency said it would move 50 wild horses two hours north of Nevada. The horses are threatened by drought. BLM officials said some animals that are suffering might have to be killed.
But things are changing. China is growing richer. There are more jobs for young Chinese people. They often move to cities or countries far away. Newspapers wrote about the bad treatment of older people. One newspaper wrote that a grandmother was forced to live with pigs. China's leaders saw what was happening. They decided to make the new law.
China is growing richer. There are more jobs for young Chinese people. They often move to cities or countries far away. Grandparents feel left behind. One newspaper wrote that a grandmother was forced to live with pigs. China's leaders saw what was happening. They decided to make the new law. The court can order children to go visit their parents more.
Ma said that she looks to other old people for company. "We're like a big family," she said. "We can talk to each other and share our problems." Some are wondering why China's leaders made the law. Or, are they worried about how much money it costs to care for all the old people? Chen Honglin is a college teacher. Chen thinks the law will save China money. If people take better care of their parents, the government won't have to pay for so many community centers.
SHANGHAI " Grown-ups in China must visit their mothers and fathers. It's the law. If an old person feels their children don't come home enough, they can take their grown child to court. Grandparents are important in China. When people grew old, their children let them move in. Their children and grandkids would take care of them until they died. But things are changing. China is growing richer.
She went back for a protest. Mateo and two other young people who came to the U.S. without permission went to the border. They asked for permission to come back into the U.S. There are about 11 million people living in the U.S. who were born elsewhere and came to the U.S. without permission. Lawmakers are trying to find a solution. While Congress works on the new laws, many immigrants have been sent away, or deported. Mateo and the others say their border protest was a way to stand up for those people. More protesters joined them at the border.
But the government protected large, old trees. The owls liked to live in the trees. Logging slowed down a lot. Most lumber mills in the area closed. Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims is the Fresno County Sheriff. She said she is worried about money for the police and public safety. "I don't want people who live 3,000 miles away" telling us what to do, she said at a public meeting last month. Mims later said she was worried about businesses.
The protesters included tribal elders and mothers with young children. There were also people who had come from other places to support the Indians. Together they slowed down the large group of trucks carrying the machine parts. They were not able to stop the trucks for long, though. This one was carrying a giant water evaporator. After being blocked, it continued on its way when police arrested 20 of the protesters. The crowd plans to keep on protesting. They said they would return Wednesday and Thursday nights.
The road cuts through pine forests and runs along a winding river. Hundreds showed up along the narrow highway on Monday and Tuesday. Together they formed a barricade " a human wall that blocked the road. They were attempting to stop a huge load of machine parts going to Alberta, Canada. The load weighed about 644,000 pounds and stretched over 200 feet. The protesters included tribal elders and mothers with young children. There were also people who had come from other places to support the Indians. Together they slowed down the large group of trucks carrying the machine parts.
The shock had muddled up the minerals inside. The result was something like shaking up a sealed box of chocolates. "It looks good on the outside, but all the pieces are ... [broken up] on the inside," Schmitt said. The study also shows that the shergottites weren't old rocks, Humayun said. "If they had found that it was 4 billion years old, I would eat my hat." The researchers plan to study other Martian meteorites. Perhaps they will discover new information about our neighbor, the Red Planet.
The struggle must continue until "all are treated equally and fairly in the eyes of the law." Many people around the Lincoln Memorial wore T-shirts or buttons. Some carried signs with Trayvon Martin's picture. George Zimmerman was found not guilty in the shooting death of the Florida teenager. Emma Daniels is 70 years old. She wore a cap with buttons from the 1963 march. Daniels pointed to where she and other members of her Georgia church stood 50 years ago. She was 20 then.
HOPE MILLS, N.C. " Alberta Currie's great-grandparents were slaves. She was born 78 years ago in a farmhouse in the middle of tobacco and cotton fields. No birth certificate was given to her family. The only record of her birth was a handwritten entry in the Currie family Bible. Not having a birth certificate has become a problem. It may force Currie to miss an election for the first time since 1956.
Three civil rights groups have filed lawsuits in North Carolina. They say that the law is unfair to African-Americans. One group says the new law is like the taxes black voters had to pay in the South years ago. Those taxes were part of the Jim Crow laws. Student ID cards cannot be used as identification. So North Carolina's 300,000 college students have to scramble for documents. Barack Obama won the youth vote by two-thirds in 2012. Cassandra Perkins is a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Some of the money will go to helping poor people. How will the tax affect Mexicans? They would pay an extra peso for each liter of sugary drinks they buy. A peso is about 8 cents. There would be no tax on drinks sold at movie theaters. Alejandro Calvillo works to protect consumer rights. Anyone who shops is a consumer. Calvillo applauds the idea of a soda tax.
The woman is missing. Officials assume she is dead. It began raining on Monday. By Wednesday the rainfall had set records. The rain was too much for the ground to handle. It was already soaked. Heavy rains have also stopped some rescue efforts. Floods have damaged 4,500 square miles of eastern Colorado.
Heavy rains have also stopped some rescue efforts. Floods have damaged 4,500 square miles of eastern Colorado. As many as 100 roadways got damaged. Waters raged. They smashed through the area. Those waters destroyed dozens of bridges. Boulder County was hit the the hardest. Officials said that by Saturday, 3,500 people still had to stay away from home in the city of Boulder.
Boulder County was hit the the hardest. Officials said that by Saturday, 3,500 people still had to stay away from home in the city of Boulder. This is called an evacuation order. Another 5,500 were under those evacuation orders in Longmont. A total of 3,000 did not have electricity, just in Boulder. Things were worse in the mountains. Power has been out for days. People have been told to boil their water before drinking it.
Officials said that by Saturday, 3,500 people still had to stay away from home in the city of Boulder. This is called an evacuation order. Another 5,500 were under those evacuation orders in Longmont. At least 3,600 customers did not have gas. Things were worse in the mountains. Power has been out for days. People have been told to boil their water before drinking it. They are waiting for supplies and rescue.
They finally did this in July 2012. To find it, they had to build a $10 billion collider. It is located in a 17-mile tunnel beneath the Swiss-French border. Scientists used the collider to slam trillions of protons into each other. The crashes produced energy. It was just like right after the Big Bang that supposedly marked the origin of the universe. Scientists examined information from the collisions. They eventually found proof that the Higgs boson exists.

WASHINGTON - People in the United States were supposed to be able sign up for health insurance on a website on Oct. 1. The website was set up by the government. It is called healthcare.gov. The problem is that it does not work. One way was to make a phone call to a call center. Operators there were should be able to help you sign up, he said. The insurance helps pay for doctors and other care if you get sick. It is part of the Affordable Care Act, the U.S. health care law.
WASHINGTON - New information keeps coming out about U.S. spying. Reports say the United States has spied on friendly countries. It gathered information about phone calls made by millions of Europeans. The White House said Monday that there needs to be new limits on how the U.S. gathers private information. A top senator also announced that spying on friendly nations would stop. All the talk of spying has put pressure on President Barack Obama. Obama was interviewed on television Monday.
The Ambassador lives in Spain and represents the U.S. After the meeting, he made a statement. He said that the United States needs to balance privacy and security. White House spokesman Jay Carney said something similar. Carney also said that technology is getting much better. That also means there needs to be more limits.
The new panels would be better at harvesting energy than the silicon panels. The new panels would be less expensive, too, the researchers said. The new material contains elements called potassium, niobium, barium, and nickel. There are a lot of those elements around. Materials in older cells can be bad for the earth. There also are not much of those materials around. Silicon is common. But a lot has to be done to silicon for it to be used in solar panels.
Scientists have known about materials with polarity for many years. But those materials absorb energy from the wrong type of light. So they have not been used to make solar panels. The Penn-Drexel team started with a material with polarity. Then the team added barium and nickel. Those elements let the material absorb energy from the right kind of light. "The nickel is really doing the job," Anthony M. Rappe said. He is a chemistry professor.
It is called potassium niobate. Then the team added barium and nickel. Those elements let the material absorb energy from the right kind of light. "The nickel is really doing the job," Anthony M. Rappe said. "The barium's kind of along for the ride." Making the material involved many steps. The elements had to be ground up and heated. Right now the scientists have only made the material.
In America, there are a lot of jobs for low-skilled workers. There are jobs for people who went to college. There are not enough jobs for people in between. Fast-food workers are suffering for the same reasons that most workers are. The government wrote the rules of how companies can work. They wrote them in a way to help businesses make more money. But the rules do not pay attention to the workers. The very richest Americans are making much more money than they did 30 years ago.
There are not enough jobs for people in between. Fast-food workers are suffering for the same reasons that most workers are. They have been making less and less money over the years. The government wrote the rules of how companies can work. But the rules do not pay attention to the workers. The very richest Americans are making much more money than they did 30 years ago. They are not getting richer because of changes in technology or because they have the most needed skills. They are making more money because the rules have changed.
The very richest Americans are making much more money than they did 30 years ago. They are not getting richer because of changes in technology or because they have the most needed skills. They are making more money because the rules have changed. If pay had gone up since 1968 the way it did for many years before then, the lowest wage someone could take home would be $17 an hour today, not a measly $7.25. Some of the changes made it easier for companies to make their goods overseas. In some of these other countries, people will work for less money. These reforms made our country less stable financially. Now, these fast-food workers are telling us that it is time for a change.
Kelley said the new rules would "increase the protection of eagles and will help develop more wind farms." He said wind farms are important. They can help stop climate change. Climate change is a shift in weather patterns. That leads to global warming. He says that climate change is "the No.  threat to all eagles and all wildlife." Not wind farms.
He said wind farms are important. They can help stop climate change. Climate change is a shift in weather patterns. It's thought to be caused in part by humans burning fuels. He says that climate change is "the No.  threat to all eagles and all wildlife." Not wind farms. Under the new rules, permits will be looked at every five years.
Birds And Bats Kelley, from the American Wind Energy Association, said that wind farms hadn't had a big effect on bald eagles. He said that only a tiny amount of the golden eagles killed by humans died because of wind farms. The population of golden eagles in the West isn't going down, he said. Michael Hutchins is an expert on wind power at the bird conservancy. He pointed to a new study. It found that 573,000 birds and 888,000 bats are killed every year by wind farms. And that could get worse, Hutchins said.
The U.S. needs a large fleet of quality carriers. Otherwise, the U.S. Navy may not be able to continue to secure the seas and shipping routes around the globe much longer. The U.S. has built new carriers that are an important step toward a better fleet. The first is the USS Gerald R. Ford. The Ford has important advances. They will allow it to be a powerful ship for a long time. It is expected to remain in service for about the next 90 years. The carriers have an advanced aircraft launching system.
And they have gear that can slow down planes when they land. That will allow them to operate planes heavily loaded with weapons and fuel. It also has a larger flight deck. And it has improved elevators to move missiles from below the deck to the surface. And fixing the new carriers is easier. That will make it cheaper to run the ships. It's true that missiles fired at the carriers could cause damage. But, the United States is not the only country building new aircraft carriers.
WASHINGTON " Some people say aircraft carriers aren't as useful anymore. Aircraft carriers are giant ships that can hold many planes. They have a long deck that planes can use to take off and land. Over the past 10 years the U.S. has been fighting terrorists and rebels. That type of fighting doesn't need carriers. Because of this, the number of carriers in the Navy has already been reduced from 11 to 10. And the government may cut spending.
Aircraft carriers face new risks as other countries get stronger. But, the answer is not to give up. Instead, the United States needs to make better use of its technology. New advances in technology could make carriers last longer. They're kind of like ray guns. Drones are planes that fly without pilots in them. They can be used on carriers now. Aircraft carriers are still necessary.
But, the answer is not to give up. Instead, the United States needs to make better use of its technology. New advances in technology could make carriers last longer. New inventions can shoot energy or lasers, instead of missiles. Drones are planes that fly without pilots in them. They can be used on carriers now. Aircraft carriers are still necessary. Our nation cannot afford to not have a fleet of new super-carriers.
Jellyfish are not really fish. They are animals without a backbone. And they don't swim like fish. Now, scientists are trying to get them to fly. Not real jellyfish, but robots that move like them. A team from New York University has made flying robots. These robots use four flapping wings.
They are mostly made up of water. They have just a small amount of stuff that's a bit like jelly. And jellyfish don't have bones. Their simple bodies look like an open umbrella or a bell. These hang down from their bell shape. They have a large mouth at the bottom of the bell. Their simple body type is helpful to scientists. So is their size.
Others can be less than an inch wide. The jellyfish robot 8 centimeters and weighs just 2 grams. It has four flapping wings that look like flower petals. The robot moves more like a moth than a jellyfish. They also squeeze water in and out of their bells to make them move. So far the robot jellyfish still has to be plugged in to work. It can't fly without being attached to something. And it can't yet be steered.
They're hungry and thirsty from crossing the border. And they pass through towns in Arizona. People there want to help them so they won't die. But they don't know if they'll get in trouble for helping out.
ARIVACA, Ariz. " Many people die each year trying to come into the U.S. from Mexico. They're hungry and thirsty from crossing the border. People there want to help them so they won't die. But they don't know if they'll get in trouble for helping out. People aren't supposed to cross the border that way. It's not legal.
Also, flying there costs a lot of money. There's not much else to do in Sochi. And getting permission to enter Russia is hard. Gerhard Heiberg is a member of the International Olympic Committee from Norway. He said some people in Norway are afraid to go. "Of course, there will be Norwegians there but not as many as we are used to." Sochi organizers said seven of every 10 tickets for sale have been sold. The chief of the Russian group organizing the Olympics is Dmitry Chernyshenko.
He said they had to get out their maps to find it. Die-hard winter fans will not be discouraged. You can't miss speedskating fans from the Netherlands at any Winter Games. They are all dressed in orange. "I expect it to be orange," Jeroen de Roever, said of the place where Sochi's speedskating will be held. He's the head of a ticket seller in the Netherlands. "We have been sold out for quite a while."
They claimed that their field, the study of plants, is in trouble. The experts said something must be done soon to get more people into the field. Or else horticulture could become a lost art and a forgotten science. They sent the letter to 800 schools and colleges.
Or else horticulture could become a lost art and a forgotten science. They sent the letter to 800 schools and colleges. It also went to government agencies, and growers of everything from almonds to onions to zucchini. The letter calls for: Coming up with a plan to teach horticulture in schools and in college; Making people understand why horticulture is important. Explaining what kind of jobs there are in horticulture. "We have to come up with a game plan.
In some states, donations have helped. California was able to keep open all of its state beaches, reserves and parks. Donors raised more than $3 million. Even with the donations, California's state parks must do less. It must also trim park hours. Five hundred fewer rangers, scientists and other workers will be on the job, said Roy Stearns, a state parks spokesman. Virginia Painter works for the parks commission in Washington. State parks there will have shorter hours and fewer guided tours, Painter said.
National parks bring billions of dollars to their nearby towns, the study found. Parks create 162,400 jobs. And that's not counting the jobs inside the parks. Yellowstone National Park announced it would wait an extra two weeks to open two park entrances this year. Local businesses came to the rescue. The towns of Cody and Jackson earn millions of dollars from Yellowstone visitors. The towns figured the two-week closure would mean no visitors spending money in the hotels and restaurants. The communities would lose as much as $4 million.
It is a speech the president gives every year. It tells Congress and the American people how the country is doing. It also tells what the president's plans are for the coming year. In his speech, Obama made a promise to take action to help make things fairer for Americans. Obama wants to make this difference smaller. Presidents have some power that they can use without the help of other government members. It is called a president's "executive" power. The other part of government that helps pass laws is called Congress.
It also tells what the president's plans are for the coming year. In his speech, Obama made a promise to take action to help make things fairer for Americans. In America, there is a big difference between how much money the ultra-rich have and how much money the poor have. Obama wants to make this difference smaller. It is called a president's "executive" power. The other part of government that helps pass laws is called Congress. Obama had a hard year in 2013. He was not able to get Congress to pass as many laws as he wanted to.
So they can tell if the water changes. It is hard to see the animals' behavior because they tend to hide in the water or under rocks,  Joel Snodgrass, a biology professor, said. The new study helped fix this problem. Scientists looked at lots of places. They were surprised by what they found. They did not expect to see so many common amphibians disappearing. This is bad news. If things keep going this way, you may not be able to find a frog or toad in half the places you used to by the time you are in your mid-20s.
A recent study said the large source of underground water farmers use for irrigation was being used up too fast. This was happening even when wet years followed dry ones. Such a source of underground water is called an aquifer. Nearly half a million acres of land are devoted to wine grapes in California. Only a tiny portion of the land is dry-farmed. Dry-farmed fruits and vegetables need more space between each tree. This makes it cost more money. But the spacing means roots spread out farther.
Dancers from two of the world's oldest ballet companies performed. The faces of Russian writers through the ages were displayed on enormous screens. Athletes said goodbye to other athletes from far-off places. Some looked ahead to the 2018 Winter Games. Winners of Russia's record 13 gold medals marched into the stadium. Athletes poured into the stadium, dancing and taking photos of themselves. Earlier, giant screens flashed highlights of their Olympic achievements. Six athletes were absent though.
Russia!" Fireworks exploded above them. The  show presented a stunning overview of Russian history. The closing ceremony started at 20:14 Sochi time. Russian President Vladimir Putin chose this year to change how Russia is seen by the world. He has wanted to use the Olympics' power to bring attention to his country. "Now we can see our country is very friendly," said Boris Kozikov of St. Petersburg, Russia. "This is very important for other countries around the world to see."
They have also been put in places where silver has never been before. Some fear the nanoparticles' small size may cause health problems. They also fear that it could hurt the ecosystem. Studies have found that nanosilver and other nanoparticles can spread all over the body. She works for the Virginia Tech Center for Sustainable Nanotechnology. Quadros says silver nanoparticles can kill bad bacteria. But they can also kill good bacteria. There are worries about nanosilver pollution.
And millions of people are on Facebook. Scientists studied more than one billion Facebook posts. They discovered that when a person wrote a happy post, their friends also wrote happy posts. When a person wrote a sad or angry post, their friends wrote sad or angry posts. The study was published Wednesday. "It was actually a very large effect." said James Fowler. He is a scientist at the University of California School of Medicine.
A new study says that people spread their joy on Facebook. Facebook is a popular social networking website. People also pass on their sadness. This may be important. And millions of people are on Facebook. Scientists studied more than one billion Facebook posts. They discovered that when a person wrote a happy post, their friends also wrote happy posts. When a person wrote a sad or angry post, their friends wrote sad or angry posts.
But things have changed. Today, bullfighting is disappearing. Some people protest at bullfights. They are against the killing of the bulls. Gonzalo Rincon wants to keep the tradition going. He is the father of legendary Colombian bullfighter Cesar Rincon. For the past six weeks, Gonzalo Rincon has trained young Andres Del Castillo. The 18-year-old practices bullfighting moves with his teacher in a parking garage.
Clinton eventually chose an area of downtown Little Rock near the Arkansas River. Rutherford said the site has helped spread wealth around the whole city. The area now attracts more than 300,000 visitors a year. Aside from the library, it has other attractions such as museums and theaters. He teaches architecture, the study of building design. Brown said a presidential library can attract people, but it will do better it if has other interesting things around it. Brown had his architecture students study the possible sites for the library in Chicago. He also asked them to design their own plans for the library.
People who live there are hoping that will change. They hope that President Barack Obama will build his presidential library in their area. Each president traditionally builds a presidential library after leaving the White House. It is more than a normal library. A presidential library holds documents and souvenirs from a president's time in office. They are often built in a president's home town. They can become major tourist attractions. Obama was born in Hawaii, but many believe that he will build his library in Chicago.
Congressman Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania is pushing for a new law. If passed, help would be easier to get and be set up through a child's regular doctor. Violent acts in schools do not just happen, Murphy said. Many had "been developing over a long period of time." Schools have added programs to stop bullying. Metal detectors and setting up ways for students to report threats have helped, too. But some programs just do not work, Sethi said. He and his team reviewed 27 programs.
He isn't on Facebook or Twitter. He has an email account, but only because he has to. Lynne Joyrich teaches college classes on media. She likes to use phones from the 1950s and 1960s. They make clicking noises instead of beeps, like push-button phones. "I keep them because they are very beautiful," she said about her collection of old phones. She does have a smartphone to keep in touch with students. But she often forgets she has it, "for the pleasure of being able to be left alone."
Still, Nader probably never sees what is written about him. He doesn't like using technology. He writes his books, not on a computer, but on a typewriter. The typewriter is a noisy machine that writers used to use before computers were invented. After typing words on one page, the writer has to put in a blank sheet of paper before typing the next page. Nader doesn't have a cellphone. "Why should I have a cellphone? I have people I don't want to get phone calls from," he says.
Argyilan, the scientist, does not just want to solve the mystery because it's her job. She has another reason, too. In mid-July, she was working at the base of Mount Baldy when she heard parents screaming. They were pointing at the ground that swallowed their 6-year-old son. At first, Argilyan thought they were mistaken. There should be no holes in a dune. A dune is a hill made up of grains of sand with no room for air. Then rescue crews saved little Nathan Woessner.
Frequently, he is surprised by the results. When he is done with a design, he colors the bone. When Border first started doing art, he worked with paper and clay. A few years ago, he found a dead elk. He loaded the elk into his car, Borders said, laughing. "I almost got arrested doing this." At home, after cleaning the bones, he noticed a grinding tool he had. Someone gave him the tool for Christmas.
They thought only men should be guides. Women, they said, should stay home and cook. "The men said this is a business for the men and we should leave it alone," said Lucky Chettri. She is the oldest sister in the 3 Sisters Adventure Trekking Co. Trekking is a long hike. The owners bullied the sisters. They would even say the sisters were "trying to take away food from their table," Chettri said. Now the sisters' company is doing very well. Men still control many things in Nepal.
Some scientists felt Myriad's patents were making their work impossible. They wanted to study new ways to prevent cancer. But the patents meant they were not allowed to experiment with the genes. They decided to sue. The court decided that just because Myriad found the genes does not mean it could control them. The judges said the company should not have been given the patents. Many businesses and scientists were watching the case. Billions of dollars were at stake.
She said they were playing "politics with our kids' health." "It's unacceptable to me not just as first lady," she said, "but also as a mother." The fighting remarks were new for the first lady. She has mostly tried to work with the food companies. Obama is the nation's best-known healthy-eating champion. She has mostly searched for partnerships. She gets food companies to make promises. Her goal has been to get companies to make small changes in their products.
She has mostly tried to work with the food companies. She prefers not to go through Congress. Obama is the nation's best-known healthy-eating champion. She has mostly searched for partnerships. Her goal has been to get companies to make small changes in their products. The Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 set new rules for school food. Obama pushed to get it passed. The law limited the amount of salt in school lunches and breakfasts.

The Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 set new rules for school food. Obama pushed to get it passed. The law limited the amount of salt in school lunches and breakfasts. It added targets for more whole grains and fresh fruit.
SEATTLE" Jim Chatters was the first scientist to study the Kennewick Man. The Kennewick Man is a skeleton found in eastern Washington. He said that the skeleton didn't look anything like modern Native Americans. But this made Northwest Tribes very angry. They consider the remains to be those of an ancestor. They sued for the right to rebury who they call the Ancient One.
Found in lakes and ponds, it provides food for fish. When there's too much of it, however, algae can crowd out other plants. Eventually, it can cause fish to die off. One algae has caused particular worry: Didymo. The stalks were given this strange name for a simple reason: They look something like mucus. When the stalks bloom, serious problems can result. Lakes and ponds can become clogged. Many fear that didymo is spreading rapidly from one body of water to another.
One algae has caused particular worry: Didymo. Didymo produces threadlike stalks called "rock snot." The stalks were given this strange name for a simple reason: They look something like mucus. When the stalks bloom, serious problems can result. Many fear that didymo is spreading rapidly from one body of water to another. On the East Coast, there have been attempts to stop it. For example, in Maryland, fishing boots with felt soles have been outlawed. The worry is that the algae can stick to the felt.
If they begin that way, it will make the shift to gun deaths more shocking. "It's gonna be crazy!" he says. The seven members of the team were selected from a group of around 1,000 WordSpeak members. These are held to help choose the team for the national contest. The goal of WordSpeak is not just to sharpen writing and speaking skills. The program also aims to give teens more confidence. Maylin Enamorado started performing her poetry when she was in ninth grade.
The two are in a small auditorium. Facing each other onstage, they speak the words that they wrote together. Webster and Roach are members of something called WordSpeak. Based in Miami, WordSpeak is a spoken-word poetry program designed for teens. In July, WordSpeak will send Webster, Roach and five others to a national poetry contest. WordSpeak teaches young people the craft of poetry. At the same time, it aims to give them confidence and a sense of purpose. Coach Teo Castellanos is key to that goal.
She makes it easier for people to try new books. The book bike was a gift. A man named Benjamin Schapiro gave it to the library. Benjamin loves books and bikes. He did not want the librarians to get tired. He made sure the bike had a motor. The motor does all the work. Jill keeps something else in her cart.
The motor does all the work. Jill keeps something else in her cart. It is a laptop. She uses it to make new library cards for people. Jill needs to know who has the library's books. A little girl named Sophie finds a good book. Sophie's mom has a library card. Jill puts the card number in her laptop.
Kids like her have special needs. The Rising Stars Buddy Baseball program in Wheaton, Illinois, tries to help young people with special needs. The program lets kids like Dungan play sports. Kids without special needs help them out. Then they play together on the field. Nicole Giambalvo was matched with Dungan. Giambalvo tried to speak with her during the buddies' first several meetings. It wasn't working.

They get the social media talk. It's about more than being polite. St. Paul's coach, Steve Mask, warns players about what not to do. He tells them not to write about injuries. Colleges looking for athletes want to make sure their players can win. Promising to play for a college on Twitter is also a bad idea. High school athletes sometimes have big decisions to make. Sometimes many colleges want them to play at their school.
Players who get hurt might not be as good after they heal. Colleges looking for athletes want to make sure their players can win. Promising to play for a college on Twitter is also a bad idea. High school athletes sometimes have big decisions to make. Coach Mask said promising to play for more than one school can come across badly. Colleges might think they are dishonest. Mask takes how his players act online very seriously. He even has an assistant keep an eye on their social media accounts.
He said that posting bad things about women or writing messages about drug use is a problem. Online bullying is bad, too. David Cutcliffe coaches the football team at Duke University. He said he decided not to take on a high school player this year. "It's just insane what some of them think is OK," he said. College sports rules have made it tougher for coaches to contact high school players in recent years. Coaches cannot text players. There are fewer chances to meet face to face.
There are fewer chances to meet face to face. Social media help coaches get more information during recruiting. Bret Bielema coaches football at Arkansas. Social media are now a part of what he looks at with high school players. Bielema said he was interested in one player. Then he saw that the player had a nasty Twitter name. "So we backed out altogether." Hand said he tries to educate high school coaches.
Everyone online can read what they say. Sometimes people say things that are inappropriate. They might write something offensive or use bad language. Some players are being punished for what they say on Twitter. Coaches will drop these players for bad online behavior. At St. Paul's Episcopal School in Alabama, football players have a new tradition before their football season starts. They get the social media talk. It's about more than being polite.
China has a Communist government. That means it is very strict and wants its people to believe that it is a good way to live. Many people in China are worried that the new SAT could make American ideas more popular in China. Imagine a Chinese student taking the new SAT. The student might agree with Jefferson about how important freedom is. This could make the student less likely to agree with the Chinese government. The College Board, the company that makes the SAT, admits that the new test includes American ideas. Some of these ideas are not common in China.

The College Board, the company that makes the SAT, admits that the new test includes American ideas. Some of these ideas are not common in China. The U.S. Constitution, for example, says that citizens should be allowed to freely say things against their government.
For example, one test might include part of the Declaration of Independence. Another part of the test might include a section of the Bill of Rights. China's government is worried about this change.

Kim Il-sung, the current leader's grandfather, led the country until his death in 1994. Kim Il-sung ruled the country and its people so tightly that the North Korean calendar begins on his birthday. His son Kim Jong-il took over after. He pledged to not make any powerful weapons, in exchange for aid. Kim Jong-il was also a huge movie fan. He is believed to have kidnapped a famous South Korean actress and director. The director said they were forced to make a Godzilla-like movie for the North Korean people. North Korea does not have the money to make its own Hollywood-style movies.
In the spring of 2012, Emily was close to death. She was just 6 years old. Emily was suffering from leukemia, a form of cancer. Emily's parents were desperate to save their only child. The treatment meant removing millions of Emily's T-cells. A T-cell is a type of white blood cell. The body needs T-cells for its immune system. The immune system keeps the body from getting sick.
The body needs T-cells for its immune system. The immune system keeps the body from getting sick. After doctors removed Emily's T-cells, they started to infect them. They treated them with a disabled form of the HIV virus. The virus doctors injected into Emily was not the normal HIV virus. Scientists and doctors had made changes to it. The virus could no longer cause disease. Instead, it now had the power to attack cancer cells.
They treated them with a disabled form of the HIV virus. HIV causes AIDS, which is a deadly disease. The virus doctors injected into Emily was not the normal HIV virus. Scientists and doctors had made changes to it. Instead, it now had the power to attack cancer cells. The virus targeted Emily's cancer cells. The virus won. The experiment saved Emily's life.
Scientists and doctors had made changes to it. The virus could no longer cause disease. Instead, it now had the power to attack cancer cells. The virus targeted Emily's cancer cells. The experiment saved Emily's life. She recently celebrated one year of being cancer-free. The treatment that saved Emily's life was expensive to invent. Scientists could not have done it if they didn't get money from the government.
That means that the NIH will no longer be able to give as much money to hospitals for scientific work. Peter Grollman is worried. He works at the hospital where Emily was treated. Less government money could mean less experimental therapies and research. The number of specialists in children's hospitals across the country has dropped, he added. The NIH can no longer spend as much money on research at children's hospitals. They will have to cut their spending by $1.5 billion this year. Grollman says that is "gutting the program."
Their goal is to make lawmakers aware of the important studies being done at children's hospitals across the county. It's important for the Whiteheads. Last year Emily's life was saved in one of those hospitals. They want politicians to know that doctors are making life-saving discoveries at children's hospitals across the country. She was just 6 years old. Emily was suffering from leukemia, a form of cancer. Emily's parents were desperate to save their only child. So they decided to send her for an experimental treatment.

She published her study on Monday. "I think people are much more open at night by a fire," said Wiessner. She teaches at the University of Utah. In 1974, Wiessner recorded conversations among the Ju/'hoansi Bushmen. They live in a vast area of 124 miles in southwestern Africa. Their lives have changed since the 1970s. Now, they get only a small amount of food from hunting and gathering. Wiessner originally hoped to learn how they made and kept friends across such a large area.
Brain size and stomach size increased. Predators became much less of a threat. Firelight also let humans stay awake longer, according to the study. The light of the fire changed how their bodies made a chemical called melatonin. Firelight let people stay awake after the sun went down. Polly Wiessner is an anthropologist. She studies how people change over time. Wiessner wondered whether this new free time let people socialize in different ways.
Other workers also would see their pay increase. All four state proposals would raise pay on Jan. 1. There are differences in how the increases would work. The differences have to do with how the cost of living would be measured. The minimum wage in Alaska would be based on prices in Alaska. South Dakota would raise the minimum wage based on changes to a national measure of the cost of living. The measure is called the CPI. Ten states have minimum wages tied to CPI.
Days after he arrived in Texas, he became very ill. He went to the hospital but doctors did not realize he had Ebola. Three days later, he became sicker and was rushed back to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas. He was in a room by himself in the hospital. Duncan was extremely ill. Because doctors did not realize Duncan had Ebola, many are afraid. They believe the disease could have spread to others. Forty-eight people are being watched closely for signs of Ebola.
He was in a room by himself in the hospital. He must be kept away from the other patients because the disease could spread. Duncan was extremely ill. Because doctors did not realize Duncan had Ebola, many are afraid. Forty-eight people are being watched closely for signs of Ebola. Ten of them are called "high risk" because they were near Duncan when he was sick. The rest of the people spent time with the 10 high-risk people. David Lakey is the head of the health department for Texas.
It has caused this outbreak to become a worldwide problem. What will it take to stop the Ebola outbreak? Two new studies tried to answer that question using math. One study suggests at least half of all ill patients would need to be isolated. The study was published by Eurosurveillance, a magazine about disease. Another study said even more people need to be isolated. Based on its math, it says seven out of 10 patients with the disease must be isolated. The second study is by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the nation's health protection agency.
During World War II, life was very difficult for Japanese people living in the United States. The American government tried to keep an eye on groups of Japanese-Americans. There were strict rules on how they could live, where they could be, and what they were allowed to do. After the war, Japanese-Americans faced many challenges. They were trying to live normal lives again.
